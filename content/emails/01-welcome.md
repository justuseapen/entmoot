Hi [First Name],

Welcome to Entmoot! You just took the first step toward bringing clarity and purpose to your family's planning.

We know you're busy (that's why you're here), so let's get you up and running in the next 15 minutes.

## Your First 3 Steps

**Step 1: Add your family members** (3 minutes)

Tap the "+" icon in the top right to invite family members. Each person gets their own login and age-appropriate permissions.

Kids 13+ can manage their own goals. Younger kids can participate with your help.

**Step 2: Set your first family goal** (5 minutes)

Tap "Goals" and then "Create Goal." Not sure where to start? Try one of these:

- "Have screen-free family dinners 4 nights per week"
- "Save $5,000 for summer vacation"
- "Complete a 5K race together"

Our AI will help you refine it into a SMART goal (more on that tomorrow).

**Step 3: Plan tomorrow** (7 minutes)

Tap "Daily Plan" and add 3-5 tasks for tomorrow. Start simple:

- Make breakfast
- Drop kids at school
- Work on [your project]
- Family dinner at 6pm
- Bedtime routine

Link tasks to your family goal when relevant. This connection is where the magic happens.

## What Happens Next?

Tomorrow, you'll get a gentle reminder to complete your daily plan. Over the next 2 weeks, I'll send you tips to help your family get the most out of Entmoot.

Here's what we'll cover:

- **Day 1** (tomorrow): How AI goal coaching works
- **Day 3**: Setting up your first weekly review
- **Day 7**: Multi-scale planning explained
- **Day 14**: Founding Family benefits (if you love it)

## Personalization Opportunities

- Mention how they found Entmoot (Product Hunt, referral, etc.)
- Reference their stated goal during signup (if collected)
- Time-zone awareness for "plan tomorrow" messaging
- Family size mentioned in copy (if known)

Example:
> "You mentioned you have 3 kids during signup. Here's how families of 5 typically set up Entmoot..."

## Technical Setup

**Email Platform**: ConvertKit / Customer.io / Mailchimp
**Triggered by**: User creation in database
**Delay**: Immediate (0 minutes)
