## The Most Important Habit: Weekly Reviews

Daily planning is great. But weekly reviews? That's where the magic happens.

Here's why:

**Daily planning** tells you what to do today.
**Weekly reviews** tell you what's actually working.

Most families skip the review. They just keep planning, hoping something sticks.

Then they wonder why nothing changes.

## Your Weekly Review Template

Every Sunday (or your chosen day), spend 15 minutes on this:

### Part 1: Reflection (5 minutes)

Ask yourself (and your family):

**What went well this week?**
- Which tasks felt easy?
- What progress made you proud?
- What small win deserves celebration?

**What was challenging?**
- Which commitments were hardest to keep?
- What obstacles came up?
- What drained your energy?

**What did you learn?**
- About your goals?
- About your schedule?
- About what matters most?

Write it down in Entmoot (tap "Weekly Review" → "Reflections").

---

### Part 2: Celebration (3 minutes)

Look at your wins:

- View your completed tasks (tap "Completed")
- See your goal progress (tap "Goals")
- Notice your family's achievements

This isn't optional fluff. Celebrating progress releases dopamine and reinforces the behavior.

You're literally rewiring your brain to love planning.

---

### Part 3: Planning Ahead (7 minutes)

Now look forward:

**Review next week's commitments**:
- What's already scheduled?
- What deadlines are coming?
- What family events matter?

**Adjust goals if needed**:
- Is your weekly goal too ambitious? Scale back.
- Too easy? Level up.
- Totally off track? Pause it and pick a more relevant goal.

**Assign key tasks**:
- What 3-5 things MUST happen next week?
- Who's responsible for what?
- Where's the time coming from?

---

## Why This Works

Weekly reviews create a feedback loop:

1. **Plan** → Set intentions
2. **Act** → Do the tasks
3. **Review** → Learn what worked
4. **Adjust** → Apply the learning
5. **Repeat** → Get better every week

Without the review step, you're just repeating the same patterns (good or bad) forever.

With the review, you get 1% better every week.

That compounds to 52% better over a year.

---

## Your First Weekly Review

Let's do it right now. It'll take 15 minutes.

Open Entmoot and tap "Weekly Review" (or click here: [deep link to weekly review feature]).

Answer the prompts. Be honest. No judgment.

You'll immediately see patterns you missed.

---

## Real User Story

"We started doing Sunday evening reviews as a family. At first, the kids rolled their eyes. But after a few weeks, they started looking forward to it.

Now they compete to share their wins first. And when we plan the next week together, everyone actually knows what's happening. No more 'I didn't know about that!' arguments.

15 minutes on Sunday saves us hours of chaos during the week."

— The Thompson Family, Entmoot users

## Pro Tips from Power Users

**Tip #1**: Pick the same day and time every week (Sunday 7pm, Friday 5pm, etc.). Consistency is everything.

**Tip #2**: Do it as a family when possible. Even 10-year-olds can participate.

**Tip #3**: Use the voice memo feature if writing feels tedious. Reflection is reflection.

**Tip #4**: Don't skip it even when you had a "bad" week. Especially then - that's when you learn the most.

**Tip #5**: Keep reviews short. 15 minutes max. Longer reviews don't stick.

---

## What Happens Next

Over the next week, Entmoot will remind you to do your weekly review (you can adjust the day/time in Settings).

Try it once. See how it feels.

I bet you'll notice something you would have missed otherwise.

And that's the point.

Keep going,

Justus Eapen
Founder, Entmoot

P.S. Next email: I'll explain how multi-scale planning connects your daily tasks to quarterly goals. That's when everything clicks.

**Conditional messaging based on completion rate**:

### >80% completion:
```
🌟 Outstanding! You completed [X]% of your tasks this week.

You're in the top 10% of Entmoot users. This is how lasting change happens.
```

### 60-80% completion:
```
✅ Great week! [X]% completion is solid progress.

Remember: The goal isn't perfection. It's consistent effort over time.
```

### 40-60% completion:
```
You completed [X]% of your planned tasks. That's real progress.

Use this week's review to understand what got in the way - then adjust.
```

### 20-40% completion:
```
This week was tough - [X]% completion suggests life got busy.

That's okay. Use the review to identify what mattered most and what can wait.
```

### <20% completion:
```
Looks like this week didn't go as planned ([X]% completion).

The weekly review is ESPECIALLY valuable now. It helps you understand what went wrong and plan differently.

Don't skip it.
```

**Family context**:

### Multiple family members active:
```
Your family completed [X] tasks together this week. That's [X] tasks per person average.

Use the weekly review to see who's crushing it and who might need support.
```

### Solo user:
```
You're planning solo right now. That's great!

Consider inviting a partner or accountability buddy for next week's review. Planning together compounds the impact.
```

## Educational Sidebar (Optional)

### The Science of Weekly Reviews

Studies show that people who review their goals weekly are:
- 42% more likely to achieve them
- 33% better at identifying obstacles early
- 56% more likely to adjust course when needed

Why?

Regular reviews create:
1. **Awareness**: You notice patterns
2. **Accountability**: You can't hide from the data
3. **Adjustment**: You fix what's not working
4. **Motivation**: You celebrate progress

This isn't motivational fluff. It's behavioral science.

## FAQ Preemption

**"I don't have 15 minutes every week"**
→ "Fair point. Try 10 minutes. Or 5. Any reflection beats none. But I bet once you see the value, you'll find the time."

**"My family won't do this together"**
→ "Start solo. Let them see the impact. They'll get curious. Or do separate reviews and share highlights at dinner."

**"What if I had a terrible week?"**
→ "That's EXACTLY when review matters most. Bad weeks teach more than good weeks. Use it."

2. One challenge you faced
3. One adjustment for next week

I'll personally respond to every reply this weekend."

(High engagement, but requires manual work)

Lead with 3-minute video:
- Founder doing their own weekly review
- Screen share of the process
- Real reflections and learnings
- "Now it's your turn" CTA

(More engaging, requires video production)
