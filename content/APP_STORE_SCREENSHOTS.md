# App Store Screenshots & Marketing Assets

## Overview

This document outlines the screenshot strategy for the App Store listing (iOS and Android). The goal is to communicate Entmoot's unique value proposition in 3 seconds while showing the product in action.

## Screenshot Strategy

### Key Principles

1. **Show, don't tell**: Real UI with actual use cases
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Simple to powerful (left to right)
3. **Benefit-focused captions**: What the user gets, not what it does
4. **Visual hierarchy**: Large text, clear screenshots, minimal clutter
5. **Consistent branding**: Colors, fonts, and tone throughout

### Target Audience Context

Users are scanning quickly in the App Store. They need to understand:
- What problem this solves (family planning chaos)
- How it's different (multi-scale planning + AI)
- Why they should trust it (polished, professional, capable)

## Screenshot Set (6 screens)

### Screenshot 1: The Hook
**Caption**: "Plan together, achieve together"

**Visual**:
- Main screen showing a family's daily plan view
- 3-4 family members visible (avatars)
- Today's date and tasks in an organized layout
- Achievement badges visible at top
- Color-coded by family member

**Purpose**: Immediately communicate "this is for families" and show the core daily planning interface.

**Design Notes**:
- Use a fictional family: "The Johnson Family"
- Show realistic tasks: "Soccer practice", "Meal prep", "Homework - Math"
- Include completed tasks (checkmarks) to show progress
- Warm, inviting color scheme

  - Annual view (top): "2026: Complete marathon"
- Visual connection lines showing how they relate
- Elegant, diagram-like presentation

**Purpose**: Communicate the unique "multi-scale" value proposition.

**Design Notes**:

## A/B Testing Strategy

### What to Test

**Screenshot order**:
- Test which screenshot converts better as first impression
- Hypothesis: AI coaching vs. Daily planning vs. Multi-scale concept

**Caption messaging**:
- Benefit-focused vs. Feature-focused
- Example: "Never miss a family commitment" vs. "Shared family calendar"

**Visual style**:
- Device frames vs. floating screenshots
- Dark mode vs. light mode
- Minimalist vs. annotated

### Metrics to Track

- **Impression-to-view rate**: How many people view your listing after seeing it
- **View-to-download rate**: Conversion rate
- **First-time user retention**: Do expectations match reality?

### Testing Tools

- **iOS**: App Store Connect A/B testing (App Store Product Page Optimization)
- **Android**: Google Play Console Experiments
- **Timeline**: Run tests for 2-4 weeks minimum for statistical significance

## Localization Considerations

### Priority Markets (Phase 1)
- English (US, UK, Canada, Australia)

### Future Markets (Phase 2)

- German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)

### What to Localize

- App icon (only if culturally necessary)

### Best Practices
