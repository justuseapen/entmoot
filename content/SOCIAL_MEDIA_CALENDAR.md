## Week 1: Launch Week

### Monday - Pre-Launch Hype

**Twitter Thread** (7 tweets)
```
1/ Tomorrow we launch Entmoot - a family planning platform that actually works.

Here's why traditional planning fails families, and how we're fixing it.

🧵👇

2/ Problem: Your family uses 5 different tools to stay organized.

Calendar for events. Reminders for tasks. Notes for goals. Messages to coordinate.

Nothing connects. Everything falls through the cracks.

3/ You plan your day, but forget about your quarterly goals.

You set annual resolutions, but don't break them into daily actions.

There's no bridge between "today" and "someday."

4/ We call this the Multi-Scale Planning Problem.

Families need to think across multiple timescales:
• Daily (what's for dinner?)
• Weekly (soccer practice schedule)
• Quarterly (save for summer vacation)
• Yearly (college fund goals)

5/ Enter Entmoot.

One platform that connects daily planning, weekly reviews, quarterly goal setting, and annual reflections.

Everything links together. Nothing falls through the cracks.

6/ Plus: AI coaching to help refine goals and stay accountable.

Gamification to keep kids engaged.

Shared visibility so everyone knows the plan.

7/ Launching tomorrow at 6am PT on Product Hunt.

Follow along for the ride. We're building the future of family planning.

**LinkedIn Post**
```
After 18 months of building, we're launching Entmoot tomorrow.

As a parent of 3, I was drowning in the chaos of family coordination. Calendar for events, reminders for tasks, notes for goals - nothing connected.

I kept asking: "Why can't family planning be as sophisticated as the project management tools I use at work?"

So we built it.

Entmoot connects daily actions to long-term goals through multi-scale planning. AI coaching helps families set better goals. Gamification keeps everyone engaged.

One platform. The whole family.

Launching on Product Hunt tomorrow at 6am PT. Would love your support.

Tomorrow's the big day.

After 18 months, Entmoot launches publicly. A family planning platform that actually works.

Why? Because our family needed it. And I'm guessing yours does too.

Daily tasks. Weekly reviews. Quarterly goals. Annual reflections.
All connected. All visible. All working together.

Follow along for the launch tomorrow.

### Tuesday - Launch Day

**Twitter Thread** (5 tweets)
```
1/ 🚀 Entmoot is LIVE on Product Hunt!

Multi-scale planning for families. Daily tasks that connect to yearly goals. AI coaching. Gamification.

We'd love your support: [Product Hunt link]

2/ What makes Entmoot different?

Traditional planning: You plan your day OR your year. Never both.

Entmoot: Daily actions ladder up to quarterly goals. Weekly reviews keep you on track. Nothing falls through the cracks.

3/ Real scenario:

Your 13yo wants to "get better at basketball."

Entmoot's AI helps refine it: "Practice free throws 15 min/day, 5 days/week."

Tracks progress. Celebrates streaks. Keeps the whole family accountable.

4/ Built for real families:

- Busy parents juggling work and home
- Teens working toward goals
- Families who want to achieve together
- Anyone tired of scattered tools

5/ Special launch offer: Founding Family pricing - lifetime 50% off.

Try it free for 14 days. See if multi-scale planning changes your family.

🚀 We're live on Product Hunt!

Entmoot brings multi-scale planning to families. Here's what that means:

Instead of planning your day OR your year (but never connecting them), Entmoot shows how today's tasks ladder up to this quarter's goals.

Instead of scattered tools (calendar, reminders, notes, messages), one platform for the whole family.

Instead of generic reminders, AI coaching that helps refine goals and maintain accountability.

We built this because traditional planning tools weren't designed for families. They're either too simple (shared grocery lists) or too complex (enterprise project management).

Families need something in between. Something powerful but accessible.

### Wednesday - Social Proof

**Twitter Post**
```
Early user feedback is rolling in:

"Finally, a planning app my teenagers will actually use!" - Sarah M.

"The AI coaching helped me turn vague goals into actionable plans." - David K.

"We've tried everything. This is the first tool that stuck." - The Ramirez Family

What's your family's biggest planning challenge? 👇
```

**LinkedIn Post**
```
48 hours post-launch thoughts:

What surprised me most isn't that families want better planning tools (we knew that).

It's HOW QUICKLY they adopt multi-scale thinking once they see it in action.

One user said: "I never realized my daily tasks had nothing to do with my yearly goals until I saw them side-by-side."

That's the power of visualization.

When you can SEE how today connects to next quarter, planning stops being aspirational and becomes actionable.

This is why Entmoot matters. Not just another app. A different way of thinking about time.

Curious what our community thinks: Do you plan your days differently than your years? Or do you connect them?

### Thursday - Educational Content

**Twitter Thread** (6 tweets)
```
1/ Why traditional family planning fails (and how to fix it):

A thread 🧵👇

2/ Problem #1: Disconnected timescales

You plan dinner (today) separately from vacation savings (this year).

When timescales don't connect, long-term goals feel abstract and daily tasks feel meaningless.

3/ Solution: Multi-scale planning

Daily tasks that ladder up to weekly goals.
Weekly goals that support quarterly objectives.
Quarterly objectives that achieve annual visions.

Everything connects. Progress becomes visible.

4/ Problem #2: No accountability system

New Year's resolutions fail because there's no weekly check-in.

Daily tasks don't happen because there's no reflection on why they matter.

5/ Solution: Structured reviews

Daily: Quick check-in (5 min)
Weekly: Deeper reflection (20 min)
Quarterly: Strategic planning (1 hour)
Annual: Vision setting (2 hours)

Regular reviews = sustained progress.

6/ This is how Entmoot works.

Not just another reminder app. A system for thinking across time.

Try it free: [link]
```

**LinkedIn Article** (Post linking to blog)
```
New article: "The Multi-Scale Planning Framework for Families"

Most planning advice falls into two camps:
1. Daily productivity hacks
2. Annual vision boarding

Both miss the connection between today and tomorrow.

In this article, I break down the multi-scale planning framework we built into Entmoot, including:

- Why disconnected timescales sabotage family goals
- The optimal review cadence for each timescale
- How to cascade goals from annual to daily
- Real examples from families using the system

Even if you don't use Entmoot, this framework will transform how your family plans.

### Friday - Feature Highlight

**Twitter Post**
```
Feature spotlight: AI Goal Coaching 🤖

Tell Entmoot a vague goal: "I want to be healthier"

AI helps refine it:
✓ Specific: "Exercise 3x per week"
✓ Measurable: "Track in Entmoot"
✓ Achievable: "Start with 20-minute workouts"
✓ Relevant: "Improve energy for family activities"
✓ Time-bound: "Achieve by end of Q1"

SMART goals, made easy.

Try it: [link]
```

**LinkedIn Post**
```
The most surprising feature in Entmoot: AI goal coaching.

We almost didn't build it. "Too gimmicky," we thought.

But early beta users said goal-setting was their biggest struggle.

Not the execution. The setting.

Turns out, most people know WHAT they want (be healthier, save money, spend time together) but not HOW to make it actionable.

That's where AI helps.

It asks clarifying questions. Suggests measurable outcomes. Identifies obstacles. Refines vague wishes into SMART goals.

Example conversation:
User: "I want our family to spend more time together"
AI: "What does 'more time' look like specifically? Once a week? Daily?"
User: "Dinner together, no phones, 4 nights a week"
AI: "Great! Let's track it. Which 4 nights work best for your schedule?"

Not replacing human thinking. Enhancing it.

This is practical AI. Not magic. Just helpful.

Curious: What's a goal you've struggled to make specific? Drop it in the comments and I'll show you how Entmoot would refine it.
```

**Instagram Post** (Graphic: Screenshot of AI conversation)
```
Caption:
"I want to be healthier" ❌ Too vague

"Exercise 3x per week for 30 minutes" ✅ Actually achievable

The difference? Entmoot's AI goal coaching.

It asks the right questions. Helps you get specific. Turns wishes into plans.

Works for the whole family:
• Parent goals: Career, health, finances
• Teen goals: Grades, sports, hobbies
• Family goals: Vacations, projects, traditions

### Saturday - Community Engagement

**Twitter Post**
```
Saturday question for the Entmoot community:

What's one family goal you're working toward in 2026?

We'll spotlight the best ones this week (with permission!).

Reply below 👇
```

**LinkedIn Post** (Weekend thought leadership)
```
Weekend reflection:

In 20 years of product development, I've never seen users adopt a mental model as quickly as multi-scale planning.

It clicks instantly.

The reason? It matches how humans naturally think about time - we just never had tools that supported it.

We talk about "long-term" and "short-term" goals as if they're separate. But they're not. They're the same goal at different altitudes.

"Lose 20 pounds" (annual goal)
= "Lose 5 pounds" (quarterly milestone)
= "Exercise 3x this week" (weekly commitment)
= "Go for a run this morning" (daily task)

Same goal. Different timescales.

When planning tools force you to choose ONE timescale, you lose this natural connection.

That's why family planning has been broken. Not because families are bad at planning. Because tools made them choose between today and tomorrow.

Entmoot reconnects them.

Simple idea. Profound impact.

What's your take? Do you naturally think across timescales, or do you separate short and long-term planning?

### Sunday - Behind-the-Scenes

**Twitter Thread** (5 tweets)
```
1/ Sunday behind-the-scenes:

What it was like building Entmoot while raising 3 kids.

Short thread 🧵

2/ Irony: Building a family planning app while barely keeping my own family organized.

We'd plan features during breakfast. Test prototypes during carpool. Debug while making dinner.

The product was born from chaos.

3/ Best product decisions came from real family moments:

- Gamification? My 9yo said "can we get points for chores?"
- AI coaching? My teen needed help making goals specific
- Weekly reviews? My partner said "we need to actually talk about the plan"

4/ Worst moment: Demonstrating the app to investors while my kids crashed the Zoom call dressed as superheroes.

Best moment: That same demo led to our seed round. Investors said "if you can build this product while living that chaos, it must work."

5/ Takeaway: The best products solve your own problems.

Entmoot exists because we needed it. If it helps your family like it's helped ours, we've succeeded.

The irony wasn't lost on us. But it made the product better.

Every feature came from a real need:
• AI coaching (helping my teen set specific goals)
• Gamification (motivating my 9yo to help)
• Weekly reviews (actually talking about the plan)

We built Entmoot because we needed it.

If your family's juggling schedules, goals, and chaos... we get it. We've been there.

## Week 2: Education & Value

### Monday - Multi-Scale Planning 101

**Twitter Thread** (7 tweets - Educational)
```
1/ Multi-scale planning 101:

How to connect your daily tasks to your yearly dreams.

(Works for individuals and families)

🧵👇

2/ Start with your annual vision.

What do you want to be true 12 months from now?

Examples:
- "We've saved $10k for a family vacation"
- "I've run a 5K race"
- "Our family has weekly screen-free dinners"

Write it down. Make it specific.

3/ Break it into quarterly milestones.

Annual goal ÷ 4 quarters = achievable chunks

"Save $10k" → Q1: Save $2,500, Q2: Save $2,500, etc.

"Run a 5K" → Q1: Run 1 mile, Q2: Run 2 miles, Q3: Run 3+ miles, Q4: Race day

4/ Translate quarters into weekly commitments.

Q1: "Save $2,500" → Weekly: "Save $192"

How? Weekly actions:
- Pack lunch 4 days (save $50)
- Skip 2 coffee shops (save $15)
- One no-spend weekend (save $100)

5/ Turn weekly commitments into daily tasks.

Weekly: "Pack lunch 4 days"
→ Daily: "Prep lunch ingredients Sunday"
→ Daily: "Pack lunch each morning"

Make it so easy you can't fail.

6/ Review regularly:

Daily (2 min): Did today's tasks happen?
Weekly (15 min): Are we on track for this week?
Monthly (30 min): Will we hit our quarterly milestone?
Quarterly (1 hour): Adjust next quarter's plan

7/ This is multi-scale planning.

Not separate systems. One connected system across all timescales.

Entmoot automates this framework for families.

Or do it manually - the framework works either way.

Your move 👇

(Not judgment. Just awareness.)

(Motivation comes from seeing progress.)

## Week 3: Social Proof & Expansion

### Monday - Case Study

**LinkedIn Post** (Longer format)
```
Case Study: How the Thompson Family Used Entmoot to Save for Their Dream Vacation

Background:
- Family of 4 (parents + 2 teens)
- Goal: Save $8,000 for Disney trip in 12 months
- Previous attempts: Failed after 3 months

What changed with Entmoot:

1. Made the goal visible
Set annual goal: "Save $8,000"
Entmoot auto-calculated: "$667/month" or "$154/week"

2. Broke it into family contributions
Parents: $400/month
Teen 1 (part-time job): $50/month
Teen 2 (allowance savings): $25/month
Quarterly review: Adjust as needed

3. Connected daily actions to the goal
- "Pack lunch" task? Shows how much it saves toward vacation
- Teen babysitting? Direct deposit to vacation fund
- No-spend weekends? Track progress visually

4. Regular reviews kept them on track
Weekly: Check savings progress
Monthly: Celebrate milestones
Quarterly: Adjust if needed

Result:
8 months in, they're $800 AHEAD of schedule.

The difference: Visibility and structure.

When everyone sees how today's choices impact tomorrow's vacation, motivation stays high.

That's multi-scale planning in action.

### Wednesday - Feature Comparison

**Twitter Thread** (6 tweets)
```
1/ "How is Entmoot different from [shared calendar app]?"

Great question. Let's break it down:

🧵👇

2/ Shared calendars: Events only
Entmoot: Events + Tasks + Goals + Reviews

It's not just WHEN things happen. It's WHY they matter and HOW they connect to bigger goals.

3/ Shared calendars: No goal tracking
Entmoot: Goals cascade from annual → quarterly → weekly → daily

See how today's tasks ladder up to this year's dreams.

4/ Shared calendars: No accountability
Entmoot: Built-in weekly reviews + AI coaching

Regular reflection = sustained progress.

5/ Shared calendars: No motivation system
Entmoot: Gamification, achievements, family streaks

Makes planning engaging (even for kids).

6/ Both are useful. But if you want MORE than just a calendar - if you want a complete family planning SYSTEM - Entmoot is built for that.

### Thursday - Behind the Feature

(Spoiler: Kids changed our minds)

🧵

2/ Original vision: Professional, sophisticated family planning.

3/ We asked kids directly:

- "Badges like in video games"
- "See who's helping most"

We listened.

4/ Result: Achievement system that works for ALL ages.

1/ Entmoot FAQ:

Your most common questions, answered.

🧵👇

2/ Q: "How long does daily planning take?"

A: 2-5 minutes. Quick check-in, mark tasks complete, see today's priorities.

Weekly reviews: 15-20 min.

We respect your time.

A: Age 7+. Younger kids can participate with parent help. Teens can manage their own goals independently.

But: The more people who participate, the more powerful it gets.

5/ Q: "What if we don't hit our goals?"

A: That's data, not failure.

Weekly reviews help you understand WHY:
- Was the goal too ambitious?
- Did priorities shift?
- What got in the way?

Adjust and iterate.

6/ Q: "Is this just for big goals?"

A: Nope! Works for:
- Daily tasks (make dinner)
- Weekly routines (clean bathrooms)
- Monthly projects (plan birthday party)
- Quarterly goals (save $2,000)
- Annual visions (run a marathon)

4. **Resolve personally**: Direct founder/team involvement
5. **Follow up publicly**: "Issue resolved, thank you for the feedback"

### Negative Comment Response Template

```
"Thanks for sharing this feedback, [Name]. We take every user experience seriously. I'd love to understand more - could you DM us or email support@entmoot.app so we can make this right?"
```

### Never
