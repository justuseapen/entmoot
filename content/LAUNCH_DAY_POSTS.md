## 1. Twitter/X Launch Thread (7 tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🚀 Today we launch Entmoot - Cal Newport's multi-scale planning framework, now for your whole family.

Daily tasks that connect to yearly goals. AI coaching. Built for parents who value intentional living.

Here's why this matters: 🧵👇
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem - Disconnected Timescales)
```
Problem: Your family plans in silos.

You have a calendar for events. Reminders for tasks. Notes for goals. Nothing connects.

You plan dinner (today) but forget about vacation savings (this year).

Daily feels meaningless. Goals feel abstract.
```

### Tweet 3 (Problem - Multi-Scale Planning Gap)
```
Cal Newport teaches professionals to connect daily time blocks → weekly plans → quarterly goals → annual visions.

Why don't families have this?

You're juggling MORE complexity than most businesses. But using tools designed for grocery lists.
```

### Tweet 4 (Solution - Entmoot Introduction)
```
Enter Entmoot.

Multi-scale planning for families.

Daily actions ladder up to quarterly goals.
Weekly reviews keep you on track.
Quarterly plans achieve annual visions.

Everything connects. Nothing falls through the cracks.
```

### Tweet 5 (Feature - AI Coaching)
```
Plus: AI coaching to refine goals.

Teen says: "I want to get better at basketball"

AI helps make it SMART: "Practice free throws 15 min/day, 5 days/week for Q1"

Tracks progress. Celebrates streaks. Keeps everyone accountable.
```

### Tweet 6 (Feature - Gamification)
```
And: Gamification that actually works.

Achievements for completing daily tasks.
Streaks for weekly consistency.
Family milestones for shared goals.

Your 8yo won't use a boring planning app. But they'll complete tasks to earn badges.
```

## 2. LinkedIn Post

### Professional Angle for Working Parents

```
After 18 months of building, we're launching Entmoot today.

The origin story:

I'm a parent of 3 who uses Cal Newport's Time-Block Planner religiously at work. Daily time blocks. Weekly plans. Quarterly goals. Annual vision.

It transforms how I think about professional projects.

But at home? Calendar chaos. Scattered reminders. Goals forgotten by February.

I kept asking: "Why can't family planning be this intentional?"

My partner said: "Because nobody's built it."

So we did.

Entmoot brings multi-scale planning to families:
• Daily tasks that connect to quarterly goals
• AI coaching to refine vague wishes into SMART goals
• Weekly reviews (15 min) to maintain accountability
• Gamification to keep kids engaged
• Shared visibility so everyone knows the plan

This isn't another shared calendar. It's a complete planning system for families who want to be as intentional at home as they are at work.

We're launching on Product Hunt today with Founding Family pricing: lifetime 50% off for the first 100 families.

If you believe in Deep Work, you'll love Deep Family.

What is multi-scale planning?
It's how intentional people already think about time:
• Daily: What am I doing today?
• Weekly: Am I on track this week?
• Quarterly: Will I hit my 3-month goals?
• Annual: Where do I want to be in 12 months?

Most planning tools make you choose ONE timescale. Calendar OR goal tracker. Daily tasks OR annual vision.

Entmoot connects them all.

Daily tasks ladder up to quarterly goals. Weekly reviews keep you accountable. AI coaching refines vague goals into specific plans.

Built for families who value intentional living. Not hustle culture. Not "busy parent" chaos.

Deep, thoughtful planning for your whole family.

### First Comment as Maker

```
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Justus Eapen, creator of Entmoot. Thanks for checking us out today.

**The origin story:**

I'm a parent of 3 who religiously uses Cal Newport's Time-Block Planner for work. Daily blocks → weekly plans → quarterly goals → annual vision. It's transformative.

But at home? Calendar chaos. Forgotten goals. Disconnected tools.

My family needed what I had at work: a system that connects today's dinner plan to this quarter's vacation savings to this year's family dreams.

So we built it.

**What makes Entmoot different:**

1. **Multi-scale planning**: Daily tasks ladder up to quarterly goals and annual visions. Everything connects.

2. **AI goal coaching**: Turn "I want to be healthier" into "Exercise 3x/week for 30 min" with AI-guided refinement.

3. **Built for ALL ages**: Parents plan careers. Teens track sports goals. Kids earn achievement badges. Everyone sees the family plan.

4. **Weekly reviews**: 15-minute structured reflections that maintain momentum (game-changer for accountability).

5. **Gamification that works**: Achievements, streaks, and family milestones make planning engaging for kids.

**Special launch offer:**

Founding Family pricing for the first 100 families - lifetime 50% off ($25/mo vs $50).

Plus direct access to our team and priority feature voting.

**I'm here all day to answer questions!**

What's your family's biggest planning challenge? How do you currently connect daily tasks to long-term goals?

## 5. Hacker News "Show HN" Post

### Title
```
Show HN: Entmoot - Multi-scale planning for families (Cal Newport's framework + AI)
```

**Alternative titles:**
- Show HN: Family planning with multi-scale planning (daily → annual goals)
- Show HN: Entmoot - Cal Newport's time-blocking, now for your whole family

### Body Text

```
Hi HN,

I built Entmoot - a family planning platform based on Cal Newport's multi-scale planning framework (daily → weekly → quarterly → annual).

**The problem:**

Most families use 5+ disconnected tools: calendar for events, reminders for tasks, notes for goals, messages to coordinate. Nothing connects.

You plan dinner (today) separately from vacation savings (this year). Daily tasks feel meaningless. Long-term goals stay abstract.

Cal Newport teaches professionals to connect timescales - daily time blocks ladder up to weekly plans, which support quarterly goals, which achieve annual visions. But families don't have tools designed this way.

**What we built:**

Entmoot connects daily actions to long-term goals through:

1. Multi-scale planning interface - See how today's tasks connect to this quarter's goals and this year's vision
2. AI goal coaching - Refine vague wishes ("be healthier") into SMART goals ("exercise 3x/week for 30 min")
3. Structured reviews - Daily (2 min), weekly (15 min), quarterly (1 hour) reflections that maintain momentum
4. Gamification - Achievements and streaks that make planning engaging for kids
5. Shared family visibility - Everyone sees the plan, their role, and progress

**Tech stack:**

- Rails 7.2 API (PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq)
- React 19 + TypeScript frontend (Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- JWT auth (Devise + devise-jwt)
- Anthropic Claude API for goal coaching
- Multi-tenant (families can have multiple members with role-based permissions)

**What's interesting:**

The biggest design challenge was making multi-scale planning intuitive. Professionals who use Cal Newport's planners "get it" immediately. But regular parents needed visual bridges.

We solved it with a cascading view: click a daily task → see which weekly goal it supports → see which quarterly objective that serves → see the annual vision. The connections are always visible.

AI coaching was almost cut ("too gimmicky"). But beta users said goal-setting was their hardest part - not execution, but making goals specific. The AI asks clarifying questions, suggests measurable outcomes, identifies obstacles. Not magic, just helpful.

**Current status:**

Launched today. 14-day free trial. Founding Family pricing (lifetime 50% off) for first 100 families.

Open to feedback from the HN community - especially from parents who've tried to apply productivity systems to family life.

Happy to answer any technical or product questions!

## 6. Alternative Twitter Thread (Story-Driven Version)

*Use this if you want a more personal, narrative-driven launch instead of the feature-focused thread above.*

### Tweet 1
```
18 months ago, my partner looked at my meticulously time-blocked work planner and said:

"Why don't we have this for our family?"

Today, we launch Entmoot.

Here's what happened in between: 🧵
```

### Tweet 2
```
The irony wasn't lost on me.

At work: Cal Newport's system. Daily time blocks. Quarterly goals. Annual vision.

At home: Calendar chaos. Sticky notes. Forgotten resolutions.

I was that person using enterprise project management for work and... nothing for family.
```

### Tweet 3
```
So I started sketching.

What would multi-scale planning look like for a family of 5?

• Parents planning careers + household
• Teen training for sports
• 9yo working on reading goals
• 7yo learning responsibility

All needing to see the same family plan.
```

### Tweet 4
```
Every feature came from a real moment:

AI coaching? My teen said "I want to get better at basketball" (too vague).

Gamification? My 9yo asked "can we get points for chores?"

Weekly reviews? My partner said "we need to actually talk about the plan."
```

### Tweet 5
```
We built Entmoot by using Entmoot.

Prototype was buggy. But it worked better than our previous system: 5 apps + sticky notes + hope.

Beta families gave feedback. We refined. Repeat for 18 months.
```

### Tweet 6
```
What we learned:

Multi-scale planning clicks instantly when people see it.

It's not new. It's how humans naturally think about time.

We just never had tools that supported it.

Daily → weekly → quarterly → annual. All connected.
```

### Tweet 7
```
Entmoot launches today on Product Hunt.

Gamification that works.
One platform everyone uses.

## 7. Reddit Post (r/productivity)

### Title
```
[Project] I built a family planning app using Cal Newport's multi-scale planning framework
```

### Body
```
Hey r/productivity,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I wanted to share a project I've been working on for 18 months.

**Background:**

I've used Cal Newport's Time-Block Planner for years. The multi-scale approach (daily → weekly → quarterly → annual) completely transformed how I approach work.

But at home with my family of 5? Calendar app + reminder app + notes app + constant chaos.

I kept thinking: "Why can't family planning be this intentional?"

**What I built:**

Entmoot - a family planning platform that applies multi-scale planning to family life.

Key features:
- Daily tasks that visibly connect to weekly goals → quarterly objectives → annual visions
- AI coaching to help refine vague goals ("be healthier") into SMART goals ("exercise 3x/week for 30 min")
- Structured reviews: Daily (2 min), Weekly (15 min), Quarterly (1 hour)
- Gamification for kids (achievements, streaks, family milestones)
- Multi-member households (parents, teens, kids all have appropriate access)

**What worked:**

The cascading view. Click a daily task → see which weekly goal it supports → see the quarterly objective → see the annual vision. Makes the connections obvious.

Weekly reviews are the secret sauce. 15 minutes every Sunday evening. Reflect on the week, plan the next one, adjust goals if needed. Maintains momentum without being overwhelming.

**What almost didn't make it:**

AI goal coaching. We almost cut it as "too gimmicky." But beta testers said goal-setting (not execution) was their hardest part. The AI asks clarifying questions and helps make goals specific. It's not magic - just helpful prompts most people skip.

**Current status:**

Launched today. Free 14-day trial. I'm offering Founding Family pricing (lifetime 50% off) for the first 100 families who sign up.

Link: [LINK]

**Request for feedback:**

I'd love to hear from other parents in r/productivity who've tried to apply these systems to family life. What worked? What didn't? What features would make this more useful?

Happy to answer any questions about the product, tech stack, or building process.

## Notes

All posts are ready to copy-paste. Replace [LINK] placeholders with actual URLs:
- [LINK to Product Hunt] → Your Product Hunt launch page
- [LINK to website] → https://entmoot.app or your actual domain
- Justus Eapen → Your actual name
- [First Name] → Personalization merge tag in email platform
- [X spots remaining] → Update number dynamically

**Cal Newport Reference Strategy:**
Every post includes either:
1. Direct mention of Cal Newport and his framework
2. "Multi-scale planning" language (his terminology)
3. "Deep Work" or "Time-Block Planner" references
4. "Intentional living" positioning (his audience values)

This positions Entmoot as the natural extension of his methodology to family life, not just another productivity app.

**Tone Consistency:**
All posts maintain the brand voice:
- Warm but capable (not salesy)
- Encouraging without preaching (progress over perfection)
- Clear over clever (directness beats wordplay)
- Optimistic realism (acknowledge challenges, focus on solutions)

- [ ] Have Product Hunt link ready before 12:01am PT
- [ ] Set up monitoring for mentions and comments
