## Codebase Patterns
- ErrorResponse concern: Use `render_error(message, status:, errors:, suggestion:)` for structured API errors
- ApplicationController: Base controller for all API controllers, includes global rescue handlers + ErrorResponse concern
- Api::V1::BaseController: Authenticated routes inherit from here, includes Pundit + UserActivity; inherits `render_error` from concern
- When adding methods to concerns, ensure child controllers don't have conflicting method definitions
- Error detection: Use `errors.where(:field, :error_type).any?` to check for specific validation errors (not `errors.added?`)
- Auth controllers are at `app/controllers/api/v1/auth/` (registrations, sessions, passwords)
- Frontend error handling: Use `ApiError` class from `@/lib/errors` and `getErrorMessage()` helper for user-friendly messages
- Frontend API client: `apiFetch` in `@/lib/api.ts` throws `ApiError` with structured data (status, message, errors[], suggestion)
- Toast notifications: Use sonner library - `import { toast } from "sonner"` - Toaster component in App.tsx
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-001
- Implemented ErrorResponse concern at `app/controllers/concerns/error_response.rb`
- Added three main methods:
  - `render_error(message, status:, errors:, suggestion:)` - Generic error responses
  - `render_validation_errors(record, suggestion:)` - For ActiveRecord validation errors
  - `render_not_found(resource_name, suggestion:)` - Friendly 404 messages
- Response format: `{ error: string, errors?: string[], suggestion?: string }`
- Files changed: `backend/app/controllers/concerns/error_response.rb` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BaseController already has `render_error` and `render_errors` methods; the concern provides enhanced versions
  - Controller hierarchy: ApplicationController → Api::V1::BaseController → specific controllers
  - Concerns go in `app/controllers/concerns/` directory
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-002
- Updated ApplicationController to include ErrorResponse concern
- Modified handle_not_found to use render_not_found with friendly message and suggestion
- Modified handle_unexpected_error to use render_error with helpful suggestion
- Removed conflicting render_error method from Api::V1::BaseController (now inherited from concern)
- Updated render_forbidden in BaseController to use structured error response
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/application_controller.rb`
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/base_controller.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BaseController had its own `render_error` method that conflicted with the concern's method signature
  - When adding keyword arguments to inherited methods, must update or remove overriding methods in child classes
  - ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception carries the model name via `exception.model`
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-003
- Updated registrations controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Added FRIENDLY_ERROR_MESSAGES constant mapping error types to user-friendly messages
- Implemented detect_error_type method using errors.where() for reliable detection
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/auth/registrations_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/auth/registrations_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `errors.where(:field, :type).any?` instead of `errors.added?(:field, :type)` - added? only works during validation, where() checks existing errors
  - Constants must be declared before the `private` keyword or Rubocop will flag "UselessConstantScoping"
  - Devise uses `:validatable` which adds email uniqueness and password length (6 chars minimum) validations
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-004
- Updated sessions controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Differentiated between "user not found" and "wrong password" scenarios:
  - User not found: "No account found with this email." with suggestion "Would you like to create one?"
  - Wrong password: "Incorrect email or password. Please try again." (no suggestion)
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/auth/sessions_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/auth/sessions_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `User.find_for_database_authentication(email:)` returns nil if user not found (does not raise)
  - For auth flows, distinguish between "not found" and "wrong credentials" to provide actionable suggestions
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-005
- Updated passwords controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Added FRIENDLY_ERROR_MESSAGES constant for password reset errors:
  - Email not found: "We couldn't find an account with this email."
  - Invalid/expired token: "This password reset link has expired. Please request a new one."
  - Password too short: "Password must be at least 6 characters."
  - Password mismatch: "Password confirmation doesn't match."
- Implemented detect_reset_error_message method using errors.where() pattern
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/auth/passwords_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/auth/passwords_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Devise's reset_password_by_token returns user with errors (even if user not found, returns new User with errors)
  - Invalid token error type is `errors.where(:reset_password_token, :invalid)`
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-006
- Updated families controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Changed set_family rescue handler to use `render_error` with friendly message:
  - "This family doesn't exist or you don't have access to it."
- Changed validation error handling to use `render_validation_errors` instead of `render_errors`:
  - In create action (for RecordInvalid exceptions)
  - In update action (for validation failures)
- Updated specs to verify new error message format
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/families_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/families_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `render_validation_errors(record)` takes the ActiveRecord object directly, not errors.full_messages
  - ErrorResponse concern provides consistent JSON response format: { error: string, errors?: string[], suggestion?: string }
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-007
- Updated goals controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Changed set_goal rescue handler to use `render_error`:
  - "This goal doesn't exist or has been deleted."
- Changed set_family rescue handler (duplicated in goals controller) to use `render_error`:
  - "This family doesn't exist or you don't have access to it."
- Changed AI refinement error handling to use friendly message:
  - "Our AI assistant is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."
- Changed validation error handling to use `render_validation_errors` in create/update actions
- Updated specs to verify new error message formats
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/goals_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/goals_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GoalRefinementService::RefinementError is the exception type for AI service failures
  - Controllers that have their own set_family method (like GoalsController) need individual updates
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-008
- Updated invitations controller to use ErrorResponse concern with friendly messages
- Updated accept action to use helper methods for clear error messages:
  - Invalid/missing token: "This invitation link is invalid. Please check the link or request a new invitation."
  - Expired invitation: "This invitation has expired. Please ask for a new one."
  - Already used: "This invitation has already been used."
- Changed set_family rescue handler to use `render_error` with friendly message
- Changed set_invitation rescue handler to use render_invalid_invitation helper
- Changed validation error handling to use `render_validation_errors` instead of `render_errors`
- Removed unused render_not_found and render_gone private methods (now using concern's render_error)
- Added three private helper methods: render_invalid_invitation, render_expired_invitation, render_used_invitation
- Files changed:
  - `backend/app/controllers/api/v1/invitations_controller.rb`
  - `backend/spec/requests/api/v1/invitations_spec.rb`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - InvitationsController has both token-based lookups (accept via token) and ID-based lookups (set_invitation for destroy/resend)
  - Use helper methods to keep accept method concise and pass Rubocop's MethodLength check (15 lines max)
  - ClassLength limit is 150 lines - refactoring to one-liner methods using Ruby 3's `def method_name = expression` can help
  - All 1618 tests pass after changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-009
- Created frontend ApiError class and getErrorMessage helper
- Created `frontend/src/lib/errors.ts` with:
  - `ApiError` class extending Error with properties: message, errors (string[]), suggestion (string | undefined), status (number)
  - `getErrorMessage(error: unknown)` helper returning `{ message: string, suggestion?: string }`
- Network error handling: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection."
- Unknown error fallback: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/lib/errors.ts` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Frontend lib files are in `frontend/src/lib/`
  - Use `Error.captureStackTrace` for proper stack traces in custom error classes
  - Check for `TypeError` with message "Failed to fetch" for network errors
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase (AuthState.token removed) don't affect new code
  - Typecheck passes for the new file (verified independently)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-010
- Updated apiFetch in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` to throw ApiError with structured data
- Imports ApiError class from `./errors`
- When response.ok is false:
  - Parses error JSON from response
  - Extracts message from `error` or `message` field (backward compatible)
  - Extracts `errors` array if present (defaults to empty array)
  - Extracts `suggestion` if present
  - Throws ApiError with status, message, errors, and suggestion
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase don't block frontend work (verified with ESLint)
  - Use `Array.isArray()` for safe array detection
  - Backend error format: `{ error: string, errors?: string[], suggestion?: string }`
  - apiFetch is the central API client used by all lib files (auth.ts, goals.ts, families.ts, etc.)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-011
- Updated registration form (Register.tsx) to display friendly error messages
- Added ServerError interface with message, suggestion, and fieldErrors properties
- Imported ApiError and getErrorMessage from @/lib/errors
- Updated onSubmit to extract field-specific errors from ApiError.errors array
- Added error alert above form showing main message and suggestion with Sign In link
- Each field now displays both client-side validation errors and server-side errors
- Verified in browser: "This email is already registered." with "Try signing in instead. Sign in" link shows correctly
- Field-specific error "Email has already been taken" displays below the email field
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Backend errors array contains full validation messages like "Email has already been taken"
  - Map errors to fields by checking if message contains field name (toLowerCase().includes())
  - Use serverError?.fieldErrors[field] pattern to show server-side field errors alongside client validation
  - Both destructive/10 background and text-destructive classes are needed for error styling
  - The session auth migration commit (629a2ff) included the Register.tsx changes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-012
- Updated login form (Login.tsx) to display friendly error messages
- Added ServerError interface with message and suggestion properties
- Imported getErrorMessage from @/lib/errors
- Updated onSubmit to use getErrorMessage helper for consistent error extraction
- Added error alert above form showing main message with conditional links:
  - "No account found" error shows "Create an account" link to /register
  - "Incorrect email/password" error shows "Forgot password?" link to /forgot-password
- Verified in browser: Both error scenarios display correctly with appropriate links
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Backend sessions controller returns suggestion only for "user not found" scenario
  - When no suggestion is present (wrong password), show "Forgot password?" as contextual help
  - Check suggestion.toLowerCase().includes("create") to conditionally render "Create an account" link
  - Use conditional rendering (!serverError.suggestion) for the forgot password case
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-013
- Updated goal form (GoalModal.tsx) to display friendly error messages
- Added sonner toast library for transient/dismissible notifications
- Updated App.tsx to include `<Toaster position="top-right" richColors closeButton />`
- Added ServerError interface with message, suggestion, and fieldErrors properties
- Updated onSubmit to extract field-specific errors from ApiError.errors array
- Each form field now shows server-side errors next to the field (title, description, SMART fields)
- AI refinement errors in the AI Coach tab now show with a "Try Again" retry button
- Success toasts shown on goal create/update operations
- Fixed TypeScript error in errors.ts captureStackTrace typing (constructor?: unknown)
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/components/GoalModal.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/lib/errors.ts`
  - `frontend/package.json` (added sonner)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use sonner (from shadcn/ui ecosystem) for toast notifications: `import { toast } from "sonner"`
  - Toaster component must be added to App.tsx for toasts to work
  - Field-specific errors in GoalModal need to map against all SMART fields (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time_bound)
  - For AI errors, show inline error with retry button rather than just toast
  - TypeScript captureStackTrace type should use `constructor?: unknown` not `new (...args: unknown[]) => unknown`
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-014
- Added HeyDev environment variables to frontend/.env.example
- VITE_HEYDEV_API_KEY: Required for HeyDev widget activation
- VITE_HEYDEV_ENDPOINT: Optional, for self-hosted HeyDev instances
- Added documentation comments noting to get API key from heydev.io
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/.env.example`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HeyDev widget needs two env vars: API key (required) and endpoint (optional for self-hosted)
  - Follow existing env.example format with comments explaining where to get values
  - Typecheck passes (env vars in Vite are just strings, no type issues)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-015
- Added HeyDev feedback widget script to frontend index.html
- Created custom htmlEnvPlugin in vite.config.ts to replace %VITE_*% placeholders with env values
- Widget implementation:
  - Dynamically creates script element pointing to heydev.io/widget.js
  - Sets data-api-key from VITE_HEYDEV_API_KEY env var
  - Sets data-theme='auto' and data-error-tracking='true' attributes
  - Gracefully disables if API key not configured (logs console message)
- Browser verification confirmed:
  - Without API key: Console shows "HeyDev widget disabled: VITE_HEYDEV_API_KEY not configured"
  - With API key: Script loads from heydev.io/widget.js with correct attributes
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/index.html` (HeyDev widget script)
  - `frontend/vite.config.ts` (htmlEnvPlugin for env var substitution + Prettier formatting)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite doesn't support env var substitution in HTML by default; need custom plugin with transformIndexHtml
  - Use %VITE_*% syntax in HTML for env var placeholders (not import.meta.env)
  - Check for unreplaced placeholder to detect missing env var: `apiKey === '%' + 'VITE_HEYDEV_API_KEY' + '%'`
  - HeyDev widget appears in bottom-right only when valid API key is configured
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-016
- Created HeyDev user context integration for feedback tracking
- Created `frontend/src/lib/heydev.ts` with:
  - `initHeyDev(user)` function that calls HeyDev.identify() or HeyDev.reset()
  - Declares global Window.HeyDev type for TypeScript support
  - Includes VITE_APP_VERSION in metadata if available
- Added `HeyDevInitializer` component to App.tsx:
  - Listens to auth store changes (user, isAuthenticated)
  - Calls initHeyDev with user context when logged in, null when logged out
  - Uses React.useEffect to respond to auth state changes
- Gracefully handles missing HeyDev widget (no-op when window.HeyDev is undefined)
- Files changed:
  - `frontend/src/lib/heydev.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `declare global { interface Window { ... } }` to extend Window type for third-party scripts
  - Follow existing initializer pattern (NotificationWebSocketInitializer) for components that only run effects
  - HeyDev widget exposes HeyDev.identify() and HeyDev.reset() methods on window object
  - Import React and use React.useEffect when adding effects to files that don't already import useEffect
