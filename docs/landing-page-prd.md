# Entmoot Landing Page PRD

## Vision

A whimsical, inviting landing page that captures the magic of family planning through the lens of "Lord of the Rings meets Minecraft" - where ancient tree wisdom meets blocky, buildable adventures. The Ents (tree shepherds) of Middle-earth were known for their patient, long-term thinking and community gatherings called "Entmoots." Combined with Minecraft's playful aesthetic of building block-by-block, we create a visual metaphor for families constructing their goals together, one step at a time.

**Headline**: "Your Family's Toolkit for Epic Adventures"
**Subheadline**: "Everything you need to plan, play, and grow together"

**Feature Cards** (3x2 grid, each card has icon, title, description):

#### Row 1:

**🎯 SMART Quest Builder**
> Turn vague wishes into conquerable quests. Our AI companion helps craft goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. "Get healthier" becomes "Walk 10,000 steps as a family every Saturday for 8 weeks."

**🗺️ Goal Hierarchy Map**
> See how daily tasks connect to weekly missions, monthly milestones, and yearly adventures. When kids see their "clean room" task leads to "family vacation fund," magic happens.

**☀️ Morning Planning Ritual**
> Start each day with intention. Quick 5-minute morning huddles set priorities and ensure everyone knows the day's quests. Build streaks and watch your family's planning power grow.

#### Row 2:

**🌙 Evening Reflection**
> End each day celebrating wins, not dwelling on failures. Guided prompts help families process challenges and express gratitude. "What made you proud today?"

**🏆 Family Leaderboard**
> Friendly competition meets collaboration. Earn points, unlock badges, and climb the ranks—but remember, the real treasure is the memories you make together.

**👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Role-Based Permissions**
> Admins, Adults, Teens, Kids, and Observers—everyone gets age-appropriate access. Teens can manage their quests while parents keep the big picture.

### 9. FAQ Section

**Headline**: "Questions from the Council"

**Accordion-style FAQ**:

**Q: Is Entmoot safe for kids?**
> Absolutely! Entmoot was designed with families in mind. Children have limited permissions based on their role, can't access settings or delete data, and all content is family-friendly. We're also COPPA compliant.

**Q: Can I use Entmoot for just myself?**
> While Entmoot shines brightest with families, solo adventurers are welcome! Many of our features—like SMART goals, streaks, and reflections—work great for individuals too.

**Q: What happens to my data?**
> Your data belongs to you. We never sell personal information, and you can export or delete your data anytime. See our Privacy Policy for full details.

**Q: Do I need to download an app?**
> Entmoot works beautifully in your web browser on any device. Native mobile apps are coming soon—join our waitlist to be first in line!

**Q: Can grandparents or babysitters join?**
> Yes! Add them as "Observers" so they can see schedules and tasks without editing permissions. Perfect for extended family coordination.

**Q: What if my family doesn't stick with it?**
> We've designed Entmoot to be fun and low-friction. Our streak system, badges, and celebration prompts help build habits naturally. But if it's not for you, cancel anytime—no hard feelings, no hidden fees.
