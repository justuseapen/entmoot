<h1>Time for your first weekly review, <%= @user.name %>!</h1>

<p>You've been using Entmoot for a week now - congratulations on making it this far!</p>

<p>Weekly reviews are where the magic happens. Taking 10-15 minutes to reflect on your week helps you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Celebrate wins</strong> - Acknowledge what went well (big and small!)</li>
  <li><strong>Learn from challenges</strong> - Understand what didn't work and why</li>
  <li><strong>See patterns</strong> - Discover insights about your productivity</li>
  <li><strong>Plan ahead</strong> - Set priorities for the coming week</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The best time to do a weekly review?</strong> Sunday evening or Monday morning works great for most people. Find a quiet moment when you can reflect without interruptions.</p>
