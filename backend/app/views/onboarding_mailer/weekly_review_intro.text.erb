Time for your first weekly review, <%= @user.name %>!

You've been using Entmoot for a week now - congratulations on making it this far!

Weekly reviews are where the magic happens. Taking 10-15 minutes to reflect on your week helps you:

* Celebrate wins - Acknowledge what went well (big and small!)
* Learn from challenges - Understand what didn't work and why
* See patterns - Discover insights about your productivity
* Plan ahead - Set priorities for the coming week

The best time to do a weekly review? Sunday evening or Monday morning works great for most people. Find a quiet moment when you can reflect without interruptions.

Trust the process - small weekly reflections lead to big life changes over time.
