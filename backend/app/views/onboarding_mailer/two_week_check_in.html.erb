<h1>How's it going, <%= @user.name %>?</h1>

<p>You've been with Entmoot for two weeks now! We'd love to hear how things are going.</p>

<p><strong>A few questions to consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you found a routine that works for you?</li>
  <li>Which features do you find most valuable?</li>
  <li>Is there anything that's been confusing or frustrating?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your feedback matters.</strong> We're constantly improving Entmoot based on what families like yours tell us. If something isn't working or if you have ideas for new features, we want to hear about it.</p>
