Have you tried morning planning, <%= @user.name %>?

Starting your day with a few minutes of intentional planning can make a huge difference. It's one of the most powerful habits you can build.

Here's how it works:

* Choose your top 3 priorities for the day
* Write a brief daily intention to guide your mindset
* Add any tasks you want to accomplish

The whole process takes less than 5 minutes, but the clarity it brings lasts all day.

Start Morning Planning: <%= @app_url %>

Pro tip: Try doing your morning planning before checking email or social media. You'll start your day focused on what matters most to you.

Happy planning!
