Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out personally because I'm building something I wish existed [when my kids were young / for our family].

It's called Entmoot, and it's a family planning platform that helps families move from reactive chaos to intentional living. Think Cal Newport's multi-scale planning (daily, weekly, quarterly, annual) but designed for families—with AI coaching, gamification to get kids engaged, and a structured review process.

I'm launching with 100 Founding Families who will get:
- Lifetime premium access for $299 (regular price will be $12.99/month)
- Direct access to me and my co-founder
- Your feedback shapes the product roadmap
- Exclusive Founding Family badge and perks

This is a true partnership, not just a beta test. I'm looking for families who:
- Want to be more intentional about their goals and time
- Are willing to commit to weekly family reviews (15 min/week)
- Can provide honest feedback to help shape the product

[PERSONALIZE: Reference something specific about their family, their parenting style, or a past conversation about family planning challenges]

Would you be interested in being one of our 100 Founding Families? I'd love to have you as part of this journey.

No pressure either way—I value our friendship regardless. But if this resonates, I'd be honored to have you help build this.

Let me know what you think!

[Your name]

P.S. We're limiting this to 100 families to ensure I can genuinely partner with each one. Once we hit that number, the Founding Family program closes forever.
```

### Email Body (Shorter Version)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question: Would you be interested in joining me as a Founding Family for my new app?

It's called Entmoot—basically Cal Newport's multi-scale planning system but for families. Daily planning, weekly reviews, quarterly goals, AI coaching, gamification for kids.

I'm limiting the Founding Families program to 100 families who get lifetime access ($299 vs. $12.99/month later) + direct input on the product.

[PERSONALIZE: "I thought of you because..." or "I know you've mentioned..."]

Interested? Would love to chat for 5 minutes if you want to hear more.

**Option 3 (Direct value):**
`Multi-scale planning for families—limited to 100 productivity enthusiasts`

### Email Body Template

```
Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I'm reaching out because I'm building something that bridges a gap I've noticed: professionals who are incredibly intentional about their work planning (GTD, time-blocking, OKRs) but have no equivalent system for family planning.

It's called Entmoot, and it brings Cal Newport's multi-scale planning philosophy to families:
- Daily priorities (what matters today)
- Weekly reviews (15-minute family check-ins)
- Quarterly and annual planning (strategic goals)
- AI coaching to help set and achieve SMART goals
- Gamification to engage kids

I'm launching with 100 Founding Families—productivity-minded parents who want to bring the same level of intentionality they have at work to their home life.

**Founding Family Benefits:**
- Lifetime premium access ($299 vs. $155/year regular pricing)
- Direct access to founders (private Slack channel)
- Shape the product roadmap
- Exclusive Founding Family badge and perks

**What I'm looking for:**
- Parents who already use productivity systems at work
- Willingness to commit to 3+ weekly reviews in the first month
- Honest feedback to help us build the right product

[PERSONALIZE: Reference their LinkedIn content, shared interests in productivity, or mutual connections]

I'd love to have you as one of our Founding Families if this resonates. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call to discuss?

Either way, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on this concept.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. If you're not interested but know someone who might be, I'd greatly appreciate an introduction. We're only taking 100 families, and the applications close once we hit that number.

### Email Body (Cal Newport Reader Version)

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building Entmoot—Cal Newport's multi-scale planning for families—and I'm looking for 100 Founding Families to help shape it.

**The Problem:**
You probably time-block your workday and do weekly reviews personally. But there's no family equivalent. Most family apps are just shared to-do lists.

**The Solution:**
Entmoot brings the full multi-scale planning stack to families:
- Daily planning (3 priorities per person)
- Weekly family reviews (structured, 15 minutes)
- Quarterly and annual goal setting
- AI coaching (using Claude to help set SMART goals)
- Gamification (badges, streaks) to engage kids

**The Ask:**
Join as a Founding Family:
- $299 for lifetime access (vs. $12.99/month later = $1,200+ savings over 10 years)
- Direct input on features and roadmap
- Private community with founders and other productivity-focused families
- 90-day partnership to help us get this right

**Ideal for:**
- Cal Newport readers who want this system for their family
- Parents frustrated that their personal productivity system doesn't extend to home
- Families willing to commit to weekly reviews

[PERSONALIZE: "I reached out to you specifically because..." or "I noticed you..."]

Interested? Reply and I'll send you the application link.

[Your name]

P.S. We're intentionally limiting this to 100 families. Once we hit that number, Founding Family applications close forever and pricing reverts to regular rates.

## Productivity Community Outreach

### Reddit Post Template (r/productivity, r/gtd, r/timeblocking)

**Title Options:**
1. `I time-block my workday. How do I bring this to my family? [Show & Tell]`
2. `Built a multi-scale planning app for families—looking for 100 Cal Newport fans to test`
3. `You use GTD at work. What about at home? [Show HN]`

---

**Post Body:**

```
**Background:**

I'm a productivity nerd and parent. I've used Cal Newport's time-blocking and weekly reviews for years in my professional life. Game-changer.

But I hit a wall: My family life had none of this structure. We were reactive, chaotic, and constantly felt behind. My kids had no framework for goal-setting. Our "family meetings" were just complaint sessions.

Most family apps (Cozi, OurHome, etc.) are just shared calendars and to-do lists. There's nothing that brings the full multi-scale planning stack to families.

**What I Built:**

Entmoot - Multi-scale planning for families:

- **Daily planning:** Each family member sets 3 priorities
- **Weekly reviews:** 15-minute structured family check-in (wins, challenges, next week's goals)
- **Quarterly/Annual planning:** Set SMART goals as a family
- **AI coaching:** Claude-powered goal refinement (turns "get healthier" into actionable plans)
- **Gamification:** Badges, streaks, progress tracking (kids actually care about this)

**Why I'm Posting:**

I'm launching with 100 Founding Families—productivity enthusiasts who are parents and want to bring their planning system home.

**Founding Family Benefits:**
- Lifetime access ($299 vs. $12.99/month regular pricing)
- Direct access to me + other founding families (private Slack)
- Your feedback shapes the roadmap
- Exclusive perks (badge, early access to features, etc.)

**Ideal for:**
- Cal Newport readers/GTD practitioners who are parents
- Families willing to commit to weekly reviews
- People who want to be intentional, not reactive

**The Ask:**
If this resonates, apply to be a Founding Family. We're limiting it to 100 because I want to genuinely partner with each family, not just ship a product.

Application link: [INSERT LINK]

**Questions welcome.** Happy to discuss the philosophy, tech stack, or why I think this matters.

---

**Edit:** Wow, didn't expect this response! A few common questions:

Q: "Why not free?"
A: Skin in the game matters. Families who invest $299 will actually use it and give real feedback. Free users abandon things.

Q: "What about privacy?"
A: All data encrypted at rest and in transit. AI coaching happens via API calls—no data training. Full details in privacy policy.

Q: "My partner won't do weekly reviews."
A: Fair concern. Start with you + kids, or just you tracking family goals. Even one person driving it makes a difference.

Q: "Why not just use Notion?"
A: You can! Entmoot is opinionated software—it guides you through Cal Newport's framework. Notion is flexible but requires you to build the system yourself.

### Reddit Comment Template (for relevant threads)

**When someone posts about family planning challenges:**

```
Have you tried multi-scale planning (Cal Newport style) for your family?

I was in the same boat—super intentional at work, total chaos at home. Built Entmoot to solve this. It's basically weekly reviews + quarterly goal setting + daily planning, but designed for families.

Just launched a Founding Families program (100 families, lifetime access) if you want to check it out: [LINK]

Either way, the key is starting with a weekly review. Even 15 minutes on Sunday makes a huge difference.

```
Hey HN,

I'm launching Entmoot—multi-scale planning for families.

**The Problem:**
I've used Cal Newport's system (time-blocking, weekly reviews, quarterly planning) for my work for years. It's transformative. But there's no family equivalent. Most "family apps" are glorified shared calendars.

**The Solution:**
Entmoot brings the full stack to families:

- Daily planning (3 priorities per person)
- Weekly family reviews (structured 15-min check-in)
- Quarterly and annual goal setting
- AI coaching (Claude-powered SMART goal refinement)
- Gamification (badges, streaks) to engage kids

**Tech Stack:**
- Rails 7.2 API (PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq)
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Anthropic Claude API for coaching
- JWT auth, Pundit policies

**Business Model:**
$12.99/month or $129/year (post-launch)

Right now, I'm doing a Founding Families program: 100 families get lifetime access for $299 + direct input on the roadmap.

**Why I'm Building This:**
My family was reactive, chaotic, and constantly behind despite me being a productivity nerd professionally. This is the tool I wish existed.

**Target Audience:**
Productivity-focused parents (Cal Newport readers, GTD practitioners, time-blockers) who want to bring intentionality home.

Application link: [INSERT LINK]

Open to feedback, questions, or roasts. HN has strong opinions on family/productivity tools—I'm here for it.

### DM Template (for interested community members)

**When someone comments with interest:**

```
Hey [Name],

Thanks for your interest in Entmoot! I saw your comment on [thread/post].

Quick context: I'm launching with 100 Founding Families who get lifetime access ($299) + direct input on the product. We're looking for productivity-minded parents willing to commit to weekly family reviews and provide honest feedback.

The goal is a true partnership, not just a beta test.

A few questions to see if it's a fit:
1. What's your current family planning setup? (Cozi, Notion, Google Calendar, chaos?)
2. What's your biggest family planning challenge right now?
3. Are you familiar with Cal Newport's multi-scale planning? (No worries if not—just helps me contextualize)

If it seems like a fit, I'll send you the application link. No pressure either way.

Looking forward to chatting!

### Follow-up #1 (Day 3 - No Response)

**Subject:**
`Quick follow-up: Founding Families program`

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my previous email about Entmoot's Founding Families program.

I know you're busy (who isn't?), so I'll keep this short:

**What:** Multi-scale planning for families (Cal Newport's framework)
**Ask:** Join as one of 100 Founding Families ($299 lifetime access)
**Benefit:** Shape the product + lock in lifetime premium

I thought of you specifically because [PERSONALIZE: reference their situation, past conversation, or why they're a fit].

If you're interested, I'd love a quick 10-minute call to discuss. If not, no worries—I won't bug you again.

Either way, curious to hear: What's your biggest family planning challenge right now? (Even if you don't join, your answer would help me build the right thing.)

Thanks,
[Your name]

### Follow-up #2 (Day 7 - Value Add)

**Subject:**
`[RESOURCE] Cal Newport's planning framework for families`

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

I know I've reached out a couple times about Entmoot, so I wanted to provide value regardless of whether you join.

I've put together a simple framework you can use TODAY to bring multi-scale planning to your family (no app required):

**The 15-Minute Weekly Family Review:**

1. **Last week wins** (2 min): What went well? Celebrate it.
2. **Last week challenges** (2 min): What was hard? Name it, don't judge.
3. **Lessons learned** (2 min): What did we learn as a family?
4. **Next week preview** (3 min): What's coming up? Plan for it.
5. **Family goals check-in** (3 min): Are we making progress on our quarterly goal?
6. **Appreciations** (3 min): One thing you appreciate about each family member.

Try this for 4 weeks. It's a game-changer even without any tech.

**If you want the tech-enabled version** (AI coaching, progress tracking, gamification), that's where Entmoot comes in. We've got [X] Founding Family spots left out of 100.

Application link: [INSERT LINK]

But even if you never use Entmoot, try the weekly review framework. I think you'll be surprised how much it helps.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. I'd love to hear how it goes if you try this. Reply anytime.
```

## Template Customization Guide

### Warm Network Customization

**Replace these placeholders:**
- `[Name]` - Their first name
- `[PERSONALIZE]` - Specific reason you thought of them
- `[Your name]` - Your actual name

**Examples of good personalization:**
- "I remember you mentioning that your family struggles with coordinating schedules..."
- "I thought of you because you're always so intentional about [specific thing]..."
- "Your post about [topic] last month really resonated..."

---

### Professional Network Customization

**Replace these placeholders:**
- `[Name]` - Their first name (check LinkedIn for preferences)
- `[PERSONALIZE]` - Reference their content, shared interests, or mutual connections
- `[Your name]` - Your full name (more formal than warm network)

**Examples of good personalization:**
- "I saw your post about using GTD at work and thought you might appreciate..."
- "We both follow Cal Newport's work closely, and I built something that extends his ideas to families..."
- "[Mutual friend] suggested I reach out because..."

---

### Community Outreach Customization

**Replace these placeholders:**
- `[INSERT LINK]` - Application form URL
- `[X]` - Current number of accepted families
- `[DATE]` - Deadline for applications

**Examples of good context:**
- "Posted this to r/productivity because you all convinced me to try GTD 3 years ago..."
- "Long-time lurker, first-time poster..."
- "Built this for my family first, now want to share with the community that helped me..."

## Founder's Script (For Calls)

### Opening (First 60 seconds)

```
Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat.

So you saw my email about Entmoot and the Founding Families program. I wanted to jump on a quick call to answer any questions and see if it's a fit.

Before I explain more, can you tell me: What's your biggest family planning challenge right now?

[LISTEN. Don't interrupt. Take notes.]

Got it. That makes total sense. Let me explain how Entmoot addresses that...
```

---

### The Pitch (2-3 minutes)

```
Entmoot is multi-scale planning for families. If you're familiar with Cal Newport's system—daily time-blocking, weekly reviews, quarterly goals—it's that framework but designed for families.

Here's how it works:

1. **Daily planning:** Each family member (age-appropriate) sets 3 priorities for the day
2. **Weekly reviews:** 15-minute structured family meeting—what went well, what was hard, what's coming up
3. **Goal setting:** AI-powered coach helps set SMART goals and tracks progress
4. **Gamification:** Badges, streaks, visual progress—kids actually engage with this stuff

The reason I'm building this is because I was super intentional at work but total chaos at home. I wanted the same framework for my family.

I'm launching with 100 Founding Families because I want to do this right. Not rush to market, but genuinely partner with families to build the right product.

Does that concept resonate with you?

[PAUSE. Let them respond.]
```

---

### Handling Objections (Have these ready)

**"Why should I pay for a beta?"**
```
Totally fair question. This isn't a typical beta—it's a partnership. You're not paying to find bugs; you're locking in lifetime access while helping shape the product.

Think of it this way: Regular price will be $12.99/month. Over 10 years, that's $1,500+. You're paying $299 now for lifetime access, and your feedback directly impacts what we build.

Plus, we have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it's not a fit, full refund.
```

**"My family won't use it."**
```
I hear that a lot. Here's the thing: You don't need everyone on board immediately. Start with yourself as the "champion." Use it to track family goals and plan reviews.

The gamification helps with kids—they want to earn badges and track streaks.

For partners, the key is starting small. One 15-minute weekly review. Show the value, and they'll engage more over time.

But you're right—it requires one person to drive it. Is that something you're willing to do?
```

**"I'm already using [Cozi/Notion/etc.]"**
```
Great! Keep using [tool]. Entmoot is complementary, not a replacement.

[Tool] is great for coordination—shared calendar, grocery lists, to-dos. Entmoot is the strategic layer on top—goal setting, reviews, intentional planning.

Think of it like this: [Tool] is your task manager. Entmoot is your coach.

You can use both. Or you might find Entmoot replaces [tool] over time. Either way works.

### Closing (Last 60 seconds)

```
So based on what we've talked about, do you think this would be a fit for your family?

[IF YES:]
Awesome! I'll send you the application link. It's just a few questions to help me understand your family's goals and make sure we can support you well.

Once you apply, I'll review it and send you the payment link. Then we'll get you into the Founding Families Slack channel before launch.

Sound good?

[IF NO:]
No worries at all. I appreciate you taking the time to chat.

Curious: What would need to change for this to be a fit?

[LISTEN. Don't push. This is valuable feedback.]

Got it. Well, best of luck with [their current system], and if anything changes, feel free to reach out.

And if you know anyone who might be a better fit, I'd love an introduction.

Thanks again for your time!
