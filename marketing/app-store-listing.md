### Version 1: Transformation-Focused

**Is your family just surviving, or thriving?**

Entmoot helps intentional families move from chaos to clarity with AI-powered goal setting, weekly reviews, and multi-scale planning. It's not another calendar app—it's your family's operating system for living with purpose.

**WHAT MAKES ENTMOOT DIFFERENT**

Unlike Cozi or FamilyWall, Entmoot isn't just about remembering dentist appointments. It's about becoming the family you want to be.

• **AI Goal Coach** - Get personalized guidance to set SMART goals that actually stick
• **Multi-Scale Planning** - Connect daily tasks to weekly intentions to quarterly milestones
• **Weekly Family Reviews** - Reflect on wins, challenges, and lessons learned together
• **Gamified Progress** - Celebrate wins with badges, streaks, and family achievements
• **Private & Secure** - Your family's data stays yours, always encrypted

**BUILT FOR INTENTIONAL FAMILIES**

Entmoot is designed for families who value growth, connection, and purpose:

✓ Set meaningful family goals (health, finances, relationships, fun)
✓ Track progress with AI-powered insights and encouragement
✓ Run weekly retrospectives to stay aligned and improve together
✓ Plan across timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
✓ Celebrate milestones with photos, reflections, and family traditions
✓ Manage daily tasks and chores with purpose (not just busy-work)

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. **Set Goals Together** - Use our AI coach to create SMART goals your whole family can rally behind
2. **Plan Your Week** - Connect daily tasks to bigger goals so everyone knows "why" they're doing what they're doing
3. **Review & Reflect** - Weekly check-ins keep your family aligned, accountable, and appreciating each other
4. **Celebrate Wins** - Unlock badges, maintain streaks, and create memories worth keeping

**WHO IT'S FOR**

• Cal Newport readers who want multi-scale planning for families
• GTD practitioners and time-blocking enthusiasts
• Parents who use productivity tools at work (Notion, Things) but home life is chaos
• Anyone wanting to apply deep work principles to family life
• Families tired of reactive mode and seeking intentional living
• Parents preparing for life transitions (new baby, teenager, empty nest)

### Version 2: Problem-First

**Tired of feeling like your family is on autopilot?**

Most families are reactive—responding to the urgent, missing the important. Entmoot helps you become proactive: setting goals, staying aligned, and growing together.

**THE PROBLEM WITH OTHER APPS**

Cozi remembers appointments. OurHome gamifies chores. But none help you answer: "Are we becoming the family we want to be?"

Entmoot is different. It's strategic planning meets daily coordination, powered by AI.

**FEATURES THAT TRANSFORM FAMILIES**

**AI Goal Coach**
Stop setting vague goals ("get healthy") and start setting SMART goals you'll actually achieve. Our AI asks the right questions and guides you to clarity.

**Weekly Family Reviews**
15 minutes every Sunday to sync up: What went well? What was hard? What did we learn? Stay connected even when life gets busy.

**Multi-Scale Planning**
See how today's tasks connect to this week's priorities, this month's milestones, and this year's vision. Purpose in every action.

**Gamification That Matters**
Earn badges for real accomplishments (30-day health streak, 10 weekly reviews). Celebrate progress, not just completion.

**Daily Coordination**
Yes, we have calendars, tasks, and chores too. But they're connected to your "why," so they actually get done.

**HOW FAMILIES USE ENTMOOT**

• **Sunday Night Planning** - Set weekly intentions as a family
• **Daily Check-ins** - Quick morning syncs on who's doing what
• **Goal Tracking** - Visual progress on health, savings, quality time goals
• **Quarterly Reviews** - Reflect on the last 3 months and plan the next
• **Annual Planning** - Big-picture visioning for the year ahead

**FOUNDING FAMILIES PROGRAM**

Join 100 pioneering families shaping Entmoot's future:

✓ Lifetime premium access
✓ Founding Family badge
✓ Direct access to founders
✓ Lock in special pricing forever

**PRIVACY-FIRST**

Your family's goals and reflections are yours alone. We encrypt everything, never sell data, and make money from subscriptions—not ads.

**START TODAY**

Download Entmoot and start your journey from chaos to clarity. Your family's transformation begins now.
