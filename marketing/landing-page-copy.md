## Problem Section

**Headline:**
You Plan Your Work Life. What About Your Family?

**Body Copy:**
You use time blocking at work. You run quarterly reviews for your projects. You plan with intention.

But at home? Reactive mode. Calendar chaos. Days blur together.

You know the frameworks work—Cal Newport's multi-scale planning, GTD, weekly reviews. You've seen the results in your career.

**Why doesn't your family have the same system?**

Most family apps are just digital calendars. They coordinate dentist appointments but don't help you answer:

- Are we achieving our family goals?
- Are we spending time on what matters most?
- Are we growing closer or just busier?

**Visual:**

## FAQ Section

**Headline:**
Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Is this really based on Cal Newport's system?
**A:** Yes! The founder was inspired by Cal Newport's multi-scale planning philosophy from his books and Study Hacks blog. Entmoot adapts these proven productivity frameworks (time blocking, weekly reviews, quarterly planning, annual strategic planning) for family life. If you use these systems at work and want them at home, Entmoot is for you.

### Q2: What makes Entmoot different from Cozi or FamilyWall?
**A:** Cozi and FamilyWall are great for coordination (calendars, tasks, lists). Entmoot is for transformation. We add strategic planning, goal setting with AI coaching, weekly reviews, and multi-scale planning. Think of it as the layer above daily coordination—the "why" behind the "what."

### Q3: Will my family actually use it?
**A:** Great question. Entmoot works best when at least one adult is the "champion" who drives adoption. Our onboarding, gamification, and weekly review structure help build habits. Kids especially love the badges and streaks. We also provide tips for getting family buy-in.

### Q4: How much time does it take?
**A:** 15 minutes per week minimum for the weekly review. Plus 5-10 minutes daily for planning and check-ins. Less time than you spend scrolling Instagram—and way more valuable.

### Q5: What if I'm already using other tools?
**A:** Many families keep using Cozi or Google Calendar for scheduling and add Entmoot for strategic planning. They're complementary. Over time, some families consolidate everything into Entmoot.

### Q6: Is this just for big families?
**A:** No! Entmoot works for any family structure: nuclear, blended, single-parent, couples without kids, empty-nesters. If you want to be intentional about your life together, Entmoot is for you.

### Q7: What's the catch with lifetime access?
**A:** No catch. We're offering lifetime access to Founding Families because we want committed early adopters who'll help us build the product. Once we reach 100 families, this offer closes forever.

### Q8: What if I don't like it?
**A:** 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. But based on our internal testing, we're confident you'll see results in the first two weeks.

### Q9: When does Entmoot launch?
**A:** We're launching with Founding Families in early March 2026. If you apply now, you'll get early access as soon as we're ready.

### Q10: Is my family's data private?
**A:** Absolutely. Your goals, reflections, and planning data are encrypted and private. We never sell data to advertisers. We make money from subscriptions, not your information.

### Q11: Can I invite extended family (grandparents, etc.)?
**A:** Yes! Premium accounts can add unlimited family members. You can also give read-only access to extended family if you want to share updates without full collaboration.

## Cal Newport Connection Section (NEW)

**Headline:**
From Study Hacks to Family Life

**Body Copy:**
If you've read Cal Newport's work on time blocking and multi-scale planning, you know these frameworks are life-changing for work.

You plan your days with intention. You review your week. You set quarterly goals. You connect daily actions to annual vision.

**But what about your family?**

Most parents keep their productivity system at work and come home to chaos. Calendar apps, reactive scheduling, no strategic planning.

Entmoot changes that. It's Cal Newport's multi-scale planning philosophy—adapted for families.

### How It Maps

| Cal Newport's System | Entmoot for Families |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Daily time blocking | Daily family coordination |
| Weekly review | Weekly family review |
| Quarterly planning | Quarterly family retrospectives |
| Annual strategic plan | Annual family vision setting |
| Task-goal alignment | Every task connects to family goals |

**The result?** The same clarity, intention, and progress you get at work—now at home with your family.

## About / Mission Section

**Headline:**
Why We Built Entmoot

**Body Copy:**
Hi, I'm [Founder Name]. I'm a parent who struggled with the same problem you do: staying intentional when life is chaotic.

I tried Cozi, Google Calendar, Notion, bullet journals—everything. They helped me remember appointments, but they didn't help me answer: "Are we becoming the family we want to be?"

So I built Entmoot. It's the tool I wish I had when my kids were young—a way to set goals, stay aligned, and grow together as a family.

We're not a venture-backed startup chasing hyper-growth. We're a small, sustainable team building for families, not investors. Your success is our mission.

If you're ready to move from reactive to intentional, I'd be honored to have you as a Founding Family.

It's not another calendar app. It's a family operating system for intentional living.

Here's why we built it 🧵

• AI goal coaching

### LinkedIn Post

**Headline:**
Launching Entmoot: A Family Operating System for Intentional Living

**Body:**

After months of building, we're launching Entmoot with 100 Founding Families.

The problem: Most family apps (Cozi, FamilyWall, etc.) help you coordinate tasks, but they don't help you transform as a family. You can remember every appointment and still miss what matters.

The solution: Entmoot adds strategic planning to daily coordination:
• AI-powered goal coaching (SMART goals that stick)
• Weekly family reviews (stay aligned, build connection)
• Multi-scale planning (daily → weekly → quarterly → annual)
• Gamification (motivate with badges, streaks, achievements)
• Reflections and celebrations (capture memories)

We're not VC-backed. We're building sustainably for families, not investors. Our Founding Families program offers lifetime premium access ($299) to 100 pioneering families who'll help shape the product.

If you're a parent who values intentionality, or if you know one, I'd love your support.

## Conclusion

This landing page is designed to convert intentional parents into Founding Families by:

1. **Positioning** Entmoot as transformational, not transactional
2. **Differentiating** from Cozi and competitors with strategic planning
3. **Creating urgency** with limited Founding Family spots
4. **Demonstrating value** with lifetime access savings
5. **Building trust** with transparency, mission, and money-back guarantee

The Founding Families program is the launchpad. These 100 families will validate product-market fit, generate testimonials, and become evangelists for organic growth.

Next steps: Build the landing page, set up application flow, launch recruitment.
