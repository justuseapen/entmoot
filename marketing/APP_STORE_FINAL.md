Is your family just surviving, or thriving?

Entmoot helps intentional families move from chaos to clarity with AI-powered goal setting, weekly reviews, and multi-scale planning. It's not another calendar app—it's your family's operating system for living with purpose.

WHAT MAKES ENTMOOT DIFFERENT

Unlike Cozi or FamilyWall, Entmoot isn't just about remembering dentist appointments. It's about becoming the family you want to be.

• AI Goal Coach - Get personalized guidance to set SMART goals that actually stick
• Multi-Scale Planning - Connect daily tasks to weekly intentions to quarterly milestones
• Weekly Family Reviews - Reflect on wins, challenges, and lessons learned together
• Gamified Progress - Celebrate wins with badges, streaks, and family achievements
• Private & Secure - Your family's data stays yours, always encrypted

BUILT FOR INTENTIONAL FAMILIES

Entmoot is designed for families who value growth, connection, and purpose:

✓ Set meaningful family goals (health, finances, relationships, fun)
✓ Track progress with AI-powered insights and encouragement
✓ Run weekly retrospectives to stay aligned and improve together
✓ Plan across timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
✓ Celebrate milestones with photos, reflections, and family traditions
✓ Manage daily tasks and chores with purpose (not just busy-work)

HOW IT WORKS

1. Set Goals Together - Use our AI coach to create SMART goals your whole family can rally behind
2. Plan Your Week - Connect daily tasks to bigger goals so everyone knows "why" they're doing what they're doing
3. Review & Reflect - Weekly check-ins keep your family aligned, accountable, and appreciating each other
4. Celebrate Wins - Unlock badges, maintain streaks, and create memories worth keeping

WHO IT'S FOR

• Cal Newport readers who want multi-scale planning for families
• GTD practitioners and time-blocking enthusiasts
• Parents who use productivity tools at work (Notion, Things) but home life is chaos
• Anyone wanting to apply deep work principles to family life
• Families tired of reactive mode and seeking intentional living
• Parents preparing for life transitions (new baby, teenager, empty nest)

• Lifetime access to all premium features
• Direct line to the product team
• Your feedback shapes the roadmap
• Exclusive Founding Family badge

YOUR DATA, YOUR FAMILY

We're a small, mission-driven team building the tool we wish existed. Your family's goals, reflections, and memories are private, encrypted, and never sold to advertisers. We make money from subscriptions, not your data.

## 6. REVIEW NOTES FOR APP REVIEW TEAM

```
Hello App Review Team,

ABOUT ENTMOOT:
Entmoot is a family planning and goal-setting app designed to help families coordinate daily activities while staying aligned on long-term goals. It combines practical features (calendars, tasks) with strategic planning (weekly reviews, quarterly reflections) and AI-powered goal coaching.

FOUNDING FAMILIES BETA:
This v1.0 release is a beta for "Founding Families" - our first 100 users who will help shape the product. They receive lifetime premium access in exchange for feedback and testing.

TEST ACCOUNT:
Email: appreviewer@entmoot.app
Password: AppReview2026!

After login, you can:
1. Create or join a family
2. Try the AI Goal Coach (set a family goal)
3. Create daily tasks and weekly plans
4. View the weekly review prompts
5. See gamification (badges, streaks)

AI FEATURES:
The app uses Anthropic's Claude API for goal refinement. When a user enters a vague goal (e.g., "get healthy"), the AI asks clarifying questions to help them create a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

USER-GENERATED CONTENT:
All content (goals, reflections, tasks) is private to each family. There is no public sharing, no social features, and no cross-family visibility. Each family is a closed system.

CONTACT:
If you have any questions during review, please contact hello@entmoot.app and we'll respond within 2 hours.

Thank you!
— The Entmoot Team

## APPENDIX A: ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION (Problem-First)

**Character Count:** 2,347/4000

```
Tired of feeling like your family is on autopilot?

Most families are reactive—responding to the urgent, missing the important. Entmoot helps you become proactive: setting goals, staying aligned, and growing together.

THE PROBLEM WITH OTHER APPS

Cozi remembers appointments. OurHome gamifies chores. But none help you answer: "Are we becoming the family we want to be?"

Entmoot is different. It's strategic planning meets daily coordination, powered by AI.

FEATURES THAT TRANSFORM FAMILIES

AI Goal Coach
Stop setting vague goals ("get healthy") and start setting SMART goals you'll actually achieve. Our AI asks the right questions and guides you to clarity.

Weekly Family Reviews
15 minutes every Sunday to sync up: What went well? What was hard? What did we learn? Stay connected even when life gets busy.

Multi-Scale Planning
See how today's tasks connect to this week's priorities, this month's milestones, and this year's vision. Purpose in every action.

Gamification That Matters
Earn badges for real accomplishments (30-day health streak, 10 weekly reviews). Celebrate progress, not just completion.

Daily Coordination
Yes, we have calendars, tasks, and chores too. But they're connected to your "why," so they actually get done.

HOW FAMILIES USE ENTMOOT

• Sunday Night Planning - Set weekly intentions as a family
• Daily Check-ins - Quick morning syncs on who's doing what
• Goal Tracking - Visual progress on health, savings, quality time goals
• Quarterly Reviews - Reflect on the last 3 months and plan the next
• Annual Planning - Big-picture visioning for the year ahead
