# Ralph Progress Log - Entmoot Mobile App

## Project Context
- Building React Native iOS app with Expo managed workflow
- Backend API already exists at /backend (100+ endpoints ready)
- Web frontend exists at /frontend (can reference for patterns)
- Mobile app location: /mobile

## Technical Decisions
- Using Expo SDK 52+ managed workflow
- expo-router for navigation (file-based routing)
- react-native-paper for UI components
- zustand for client state
- @tanstack/react-query for server state
- expo-secure-store for auth token storage
- MMKV for offline caching
- Session-based auth (not JWT)

## API Base URL
- Development: http://localhost:3000/api/v1
- All endpoints documented in backend/app/controllers/api/v1/

## Key Backend Endpoints
- Auth: POST /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/logout, GET /auth/me
- Families: GET/POST /families, GET /families/:id/members
- Daily Plans: GET /families/:id/daily_plans/today, PATCH /families/:id/daily_plans/:id
- Habits: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /families/:id/habits
- Goals: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /families/:id/goals, POST /goals/:id/refine
- Reflections: GET/POST/PATCH /families/:id/reflections
- Reviews: GET /families/:id/weekly_reviews/current
- Notifications: GET /notifications, POST /device_tokens
- User: GET /users/me/points, /users/me/streaks, /users/me/badges

## Codebase Patterns
- Use /bin/bash -c '...' for commands requiring asdf node (v23+) since Expo 54 requires Node 20+
- Path aliases: @/ maps to src/, @shared maps to ../shared (configured in tsconfig.json and babel.config.js)
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck before committing
- iOS bundle identifier: com.entmoot.mobile
- Environment variables via react-native-dotenv: import { API_URL } from "@env"; (TypeScript types in src/types/env.d.ts)
- Jest configured with jest-expo preset; use `npm test` or `npm run test:watch`
- @env mock in __mocks__/@env.js for tests
- expo-router: File-based routing in /app directory, main entry point is "expo-router/entry" in package.json
- Design colors: primary=#4F46E5, secondary=#2D5A27, background=#FFF8E7, earthBrown=#795548
- UI components: Import from @/components/ui (Typography, Button, Card, Input, LoadingSpinner)
- Theme colors: Import COLORS from @/theme/colors for consistent styling
- Use @expo/vector-icons Ionicons for icons (already installed)
- API client: Use `api.get<T>`, `api.post<T>`, `api.patch<T>`, `api.del<T>` for typed requests with auto-auth
- QueryClient: Import from @/lib/queryClient for TanStack Query setup
- Auth store: Import useAuthStore or useAuth from @/stores; use currentFamilyId for family-scoped API calls
- Family ID persistence: setCurrentFamily(id) persists to SecureStore and updates zustand state
- Services: Import from @/services (secureStorage, biometrics) for platform services
- Biometric auth: Use shouldPromptBiometric() before authenticate(); respects user preference + device capability
- Data hooks: Import useTodayPlan, useUpdateDailyPlan from @/hooks for daily plan data; uses TanStack Query with optimistic updates
- Query keys pattern: Use exported keys objects (e.g., dailyPlanKeys) for consistent cache management
- Bottom sheet modals: Use @gorhom/bottom-sheet with react-native-reanimated; configure reanimated plugin last in babel.config.js
- Goals hook: Import useGoals, Goal from @/hooks; filter by status with useGoals({ status: "in_progress" })
- Components barrel export: Import from @/components (FirstGoalPrompt, AddPriorityModal) for shared components

## Learnings
(Ralph will append learnings here as iterations progress)

---

## 2026-01-21 - US-001
- What was implemented: Completed Expo project initialization requirements
- Files changed: babel.config.js (created), app.json (updated bundle ID, iOS min version), package.json (babel-plugin-module-resolver added)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Expo 54 requires Node.js 20+; use asdf shims for correct version
  - expo-constants should NOT be in plugins array (it's not a config plugin)
  - The project already had React Navigation setup (not expo-router) - existing structure should be preserved
  - Use `/bin/bash -c '/Users/justuseapen/.asdf/shims/npx ...'` pattern for expo commands
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-002
- What was implemented: Configured development environment with testing and env variable support
- Files changed:
  - .prettierrc (extended with additional rules)
  - .env.example (created with API_URL)
  - package.json (added test scripts, jest, jest-expo, @testing-library/react-native, react-native-dotenv)
  - babel.config.js (added react-native-dotenv plugin)
  - jest.config.js (created with jest-expo preset and path aliases)
  - jest.setup.js (created for @testing-library/react-native setup)
  - src/types/env.d.ts (created TypeScript declaration for @env module)
  - __mocks__/@env.js (created mock for tests)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ESLint was already configured with TypeScript and React plugins (not @react-native/eslint-config but works)
  - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing @testing-library/react-native due to React 19 peer conflicts
  - Jest setup file path must be `<rootDir>/jest.setup.js` not the package path directly
  - git root is /washington, not /washington/mobile - use relative paths when staging files
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-003
- What was implemented: Set up navigation structure with expo-router file-based routing
- Files changed:
  - app.json (added scheme, web bundler, expo-router plugin)
  - package.json (changed main to expo-router/entry, added expo-router and dependencies)
  - app/_layout.tsx (root layout with auth guard)
  - app/(auth)/_layout.tsx, login.tsx, register.tsx, forgot-password.tsx (auth screens)
  - app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx, today.tsx, goals.tsx, me.tsx (main tabs with icons)
  - app/onboarding/index.tsx, app/settings/index.tsx, app/goal/[id].tsx (stack screens)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - expo-router uses app/ directory for file-based routing (not src/)
  - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing packages with React 19 peer dependency conflicts
  - The existing src/navigation/ React Navigation code still exists but is not used by expo-router
  - useSegments() returns the current route segments for auth guard logic
  - Tab bar icons use @expo/vector-icons/Ionicons - import with { Ionicons } from "@expo/vector-icons"
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-004
- What was implemented: Created design system foundation with reusable UI components
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added react-native-paper)
  - app/_layout.tsx (configured PaperProvider with custom theme)
  - src/theme/colors.ts (created with brand colors and paper theme colors)
  - src/components/ui/Typography.tsx (H1, H2, H3, Body, Caption variants)
  - src/components/ui/Button.tsx (primary, secondary, outline, ghost variants)
  - src/components/ui/Card.tsx (default, outlined, elevated variants + PressableCard)
  - src/components/ui/Input.tsx (with label, error state, helper text)
  - src/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx (with optional message and fullScreen mode)
  - src/components/ui/index.ts (barrel export file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - react-native-paper uses MD3LightTheme as base theme, extend colors with spread operator
  - PaperProvider must wrap the entire app tree (wrap SafeAreaProvider inside)
  - Custom UI components don't need to wrap Paper components - plain React Native works well
  - Use COLORS from @/theme/colors for consistent styling across the app
  - Button/Card variants are implemented as StyleSheet combinations, not separate components
  - Import components from @/components/ui (barrel export pattern)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-005
- What was implemented: Created secure storage service for auth tokens and sensitive data
- Files changed:
  - package.json (expo-secure-store version updated)
  - src/services/secureStorage.ts (created with all secure storage functions)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - expo-secure-store was already in package.json but at an older version - npm install updated it
  - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` when installing packages due to React 19 peer dependency conflicts
  - Import from expo-secure-store: setItemAsync, getItemAsync, deleteItemAsync (not set/get/delete)
  - STORAGE_KEYS constants help prevent typos and enable TypeScript autocomplete
  - clearAuthData() helper is useful for logout - clears all auth-related keys at once
  - Services directory is at src/services/ for platform-specific services
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-006
- What was implemented: Created API client with typed convenience methods and TanStack Query setup
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @tanstack/react-query)
  - src/lib/api.ts (added typed get<T>, post<T>, patch<T>, del<T> methods)
  - src/lib/queryClient.ts (created with mobile-optimized defaults)
  - src/lib/index.ts (added queryClient export)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API client was already mostly implemented at src/lib/api.ts with auth token handling
  - apiClient.setOnAuthError() callback handles 401 redirects (already connected in authStore)
  - Use `api.get<T>('/endpoint')` for typed GET requests with auto-auth
  - QueryClient defaults: 5min staleTime, 30min gcTime, refetchOnWindowFocus=false (better mobile UX)
  - Config uses expo-constants to detect environment (development/staging/production)
  - API base URL comes from src/lib/config.ts, not @env module
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-007
- What was implemented: Enhanced auth store with currentFamilyId state and setCurrentFamily action
- Files changed:
  - src/stores/auth.ts (added currentFamilyId state, setCurrentFamily action, useAuth hook alias)
  - src/stores/index.ts (added useAuth export)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Auth store already existed with zustand, login/logout/register actions, and JWT token handling
  - zustand was already installed in package.json (v5.0.2)
  - The store uses custom JWT implementation with token refresh, not Rails session-based auth
  - Import useAuthStore or useAuth from @/stores - both work identically
  - currentFamilyId is persisted to SecureStore as FAMILY_ID_KEY ("entmoot_family_id")
  - setCurrentFamily action both persists to storage AND updates zustand state
  - The store already has apiClient callbacks for token refresh and auth errors
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-008
- What was implemented: Built full login screen with complete UI and functionality
- Files changed:
  - app/(auth)/login.tsx (complete rewrite with form, validation, navigation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use KeyboardAvoidingView with ScrollView pattern for forms with keyboard
  - Input component from @/components/ui supports error prop for validation messages
  - Button component supports loading prop which shows ActivityIndicator
  - authStore.login() is async and throws error on failure - catch and show Alert
  - Use router.replace for navigation after successful login (not push)
  - router.push for navigating to other auth screens (forgot-password, register)
  - Password show/hide toggle: position absolute TouchableOpacity with Ionicons eye icon
  - Form validation should clear errors when user starts typing in that field
  - Use hitSlop on touch targets for better accessibility
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-009
- What was implemented: Built full registration screen with complete form and error handling
- Files changed:
  - app/(auth)/register.tsx (complete rewrite with registration form UI)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Registration uses authStore.register() which handles saving tokens and user state automatically
  - RegisterData type from @shared/types requires: name, email, password, password_confirmation
  - API validation errors may come as JSON with field-level errors (email, password, name, password_confirmation arrays)
  - Use router.back() for "Log In" link since register is pushed from login screen
  - Both password fields have show/hide toggles - use separate state (showPassword, showConfirmPassword)
  - autoComplete="new-password" for registration password fields (vs "password" for login)
  - helperText prop on Input component shows text below input (used for password requirements)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-010
- What was implemented: Built forgot password screen with email reset functionality
- Files changed:
  - app/(auth)/forgot-password.tsx (complete rewrite with forgot password form)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use apiFetch for unauthenticated API calls (password reset doesn't require auth)
  - Success alert uses array of buttons to navigate user back to login
  - COLORS.text is the correct color for primary text (not textPrimary which doesn't exist)
  - Generic success message avoids revealing whether email exists in system (security best practice)
  - Back button with Ionicons arrow-back provides clear navigation affordance
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-011
- What was implemented: Biometric authentication with Face ID/Touch ID support
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added expo-local-authentication)
  - src/services/biometrics.ts (created with all biometric functions)
  - src/services/index.ts (created barrel export for services)
  - app/_layout.tsx (updated AuthGuard for biometric prompt on foreground)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - expo-local-authentication uses SecurityLevel enum (BIOMETRIC_STRONG, BIOMETRIC_WEAK) for capability check
  - Use AuthenticationType enum (FACIAL_RECOGNITION, FINGERPRINT) to determine biometric type
  - AppState API with addEventListener "change" detects foreground/background transitions
  - Use useRef for appState and biometricPromptShown to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - shouldPromptBiometric helper combines availability check + preference check + session check
  - biometricLocked state prevents navigation while biometric prompt is active
  - Services barrel export at src/services/index.ts enables cleaner imports
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-012
- What was implemented: Built onboarding welcome flow with 4 swipeable pages
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added react-native-pager-view)
  - app/onboarding/index.tsx (complete rewrite with PagerView for swiping)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - react-native-pager-view requires --legacy-peer-deps due to React 19 peer dependency conflicts
  - PagerView uses onPageSelected callback with e.nativeEvent.position for page tracking
  - Use useRef<PagerView> with pagerRef.current.setPage(n) for programmatic navigation
  - Page indicators: active indicator can be wider (24px vs 8px) for visual emphasis
  - Ionicons provides good icons for onboarding: leaf, sunny, checkmark-circle, trophy
  - router.push is correct for onboarding → family-setup navigation (not replace)
  - SafeAreaView needed for proper spacing on devices with notch
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-013
- What was implemented: Built family setup screen with create/join family options
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added expo-localization)
  - app.json (added expo-localization plugin)
  - app/onboarding/family-setup.tsx (created - full implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - expo-localization uses getCalendars()[0].timeZone for timezone detection (not Localization.timezone)
  - PressableCard from @/components/ui is perfect for selectable option cards
  - Use mode state pattern ("select" | "create" | "join") for multi-step forms with back navigation
  - api.post<T> from @/lib/api handles auth automatically and returns typed response
  - setCurrentFamily(id) from authStore persists to SecureStore and updates zustand state
  - router.replace('/(tabs)/today') for navigation after family setup (no back option)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-014
- What was implemented: Built First Goal Prompt modal component for new user onboarding
- Files changed:
  - src/components/FirstGoalPrompt.tsx (created - modal component with suggestion cards)
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (integrated FirstGoalPrompt with eligibility check)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Modal with presentationStyle="pageSheet" for native iOS sheet-style modals
  - Create companion hook (useFirstGoalPrompt) alongside modal component for eligibility checking
  - PressableCard variant="elevated" with custom borderColor for selected state looks good
  - Radio-style selection UI: radioCircle with inner filled circle on selection
  - Custom goal mode: switch from suggestions to TextInput with back navigation
  - KeyboardAvoidingView with behavior="padding" on iOS for forms in modals
  - Default suggestions as fallback when API doesn't return suggestions or errors
  - isCustomMode state pattern for toggling between selection and input modes
  - API endpoints: GET /users/me/first_goal_prompt (eligibility), POST /users/me/first_goal_prompt/dismiss (dismiss)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-015
- What was implemented: Created daily plan data layer with hooks for fetching and updating daily plans
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useDailyPlan.ts (created - all types and hooks)
  - src/hooks/index.ts (updated - export new hooks and types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Daily plan API uses nested attributes pattern: daily_tasks_attributes, top_priorities_attributes, habit_completions_attributes
  - TanStack Query optimistic updates: use onMutate to snapshot and update cache, onError to rollback, onSuccess to sync with server
  - Query keys pattern: dailyPlanKeys.today(familyId) enables easy invalidation and cache management
  - HabitCompletion has nested habit info (habit.name, habit.position, habit.is_active)
  - CompletionStats provides task/priority/habit completion counts for progress display
  - _destroy: true in nested attributes tells Rails to delete the record
  - Use Date.now() as temporary ID for optimistic new items (server will replace with real ID)
  - useAuthStore((state) => state.currentFamilyId) for accessing family ID in hooks
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-016
- What was implemented: Built Today Screen Header with date, greeting, and completion stats
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added date-fns)
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (complete rewrite with header section)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - date-fns format() with "EEEE, MMMM d" gives "Wednesday, January 22" format
  - Use SafeAreaView edges={["top"]} for screens with custom headers (not system header)
  - RefreshControl: use refreshing={isFetching && !isLoading} to avoid showing spinner on initial load
  - Skeleton components: simple Views with backgroundColor matching COLORS.surface look good
  - CompletionStats from daily plan has tasks_total, tasks_completed, priorities_total, priorities_completed, habits_total, habits_completed
  - User name available via useAuthStore((state) => state.user?.name)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-017
- What was implemented: Built Today's Intention section with inline editing and save functionality
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (added IntentionSection component with edit mode)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useRef<TextInput> with setTimeout focus pattern for delayed focus after state update
  - Inline edit pattern: isEditing state, TouchableOpacity for display, TextInput for edit
  - Compare trimmed values before saving to avoid unnecessary API calls
  - Show saving indicator using ActivityIndicator with "Saving..." text next to section title
  - useUpdateDailyPlan from @/hooks/useDailyPlan handles intention updates with optimistic UI
  - Sync local state from props using useEffect when not editing (for server sync)
  - blurOnSubmit + returnKeyType="done" makes TextInput behave like single-line with done key
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-018
- What was implemented: Built Today Screen Top Priorities section with full functionality
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added expo-haptics, react-native-gesture-handler)
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (added TopPrioritiesSection, TopPriorityItem components)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use GestureHandlerRootView wrapper for swipe gestures - wrap entire screen content
  - expo-haptics: Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light) for checkbox, Medium for delete
  - Swipeable from react-native-gesture-handler: use ref for programmatic close after delete
  - renderRightActions receives dragX for animation interpolation
  - Goal badge: use COLORS.primary + "15" for 15% opacity background
  - Animated.AnimatedInterpolation<number> for proper TypeScript typing with interpolate()
  - Top priorities max 3: disable Add button with visual feedback when limit reached
  - Loading skeleton: render 3 placeholder items for visual consistency
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-019
- What was implemented: Built Today Screen Non-Negotiables (Habits) Section
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (added HabitsSection, HabitItem components, new styles)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Habits data comes from habit_completions in daily plan response (not separate habits endpoint)
  - Backend habits API doesn't include streak data per-habit yet - streak badge UI is ready but not populated
  - Sort habits by habit.position to maintain user's preferred order
  - Reuse existing checkbox styles from priorities for visual consistency
  - habit_completions_attributes uses completion id (not habit_id) for updates
  - Empty state should guide users to Settings to add habits
  - Completion count shows X/Y completed in section header (same pattern as priorities)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-020
- What was implemented: Built Today Screen Tasks Section with full CRUD functionality
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (added TaskItem, TasksSection components, new task styles)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tasks use same pattern as priorities: TaskItem component with swipe-to-delete and checkbox
  - DailyTask type already exists in useDailyPlan.ts with all needed fields (title, completed, position, assignee, goal)
  - daily_tasks_attributes supports _destroy: true for deleting tasks
  - New tasks need position property set to current length for proper ordering
  - Assignee avatar shows initials on colored background when avatar_url is null
  - Inline TextInput with onSubmitEditing pattern for quick task entry
  - Show add button only when input has content (cleaner UX)
  - Reuse checkbox, deleteAction styles from priorities for visual consistency
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-021
- What was implemented: Built Add Priority Modal with bottom sheet and goal picker
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added @gorhom/bottom-sheet, react-native-reanimated)

  - src/hooks/useGoals.ts (new - useGoals hook with Goal types)
  - src/hooks/index.ts (export new hooks and types)
  - src/components/AddPriorityModal.tsx (new - bottom sheet modal component)
  - src/components/index.ts (new - components barrel export)
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (integrated AddPriorityModal)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - @gorhom/bottom-sheet requires react-native-reanimated as peer dependency
  - react-native-reanimated/plugin MUST be listed last in babel plugins array
  - Use --legacy-peer-deps when installing packages due to React 19 peer dependency conflicts
  - BottomSheet uses index={-1} to start closed, expand() to open
  - BottomSheetBackdrop: disappearsOnIndex={-1}, appearsOnIndex={0} for proper backdrop behavior
  - Goal picker implemented as custom dropdown with selectable list (not Picker component)
  - Use keyboardBehavior="interactive" for smooth keyboard handling in bottom sheet
  - Goals can be filtered by status: useGoals({ status: "in_progress" })
  - useGoals returns Goal[] (not paginated) from /families/:id/goals endpoint
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-022
- What was implemented: Built End-of-Day Reflection Prompt with banner and modal
- Files changed:
  - src/components/EveningReflectionBanner.tsx (new - banner and reflection modal)
  - src/components/index.ts (export new component and helper functions)
  - app/(tabs)/today.tsx (integrated EveningReflectionBanner)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use BottomSheetScrollView for modals with forms to ensure content is scrollable
  - isEveningTime() and needsEveningReflection() helper functions exported for reuse
  - Mood selector: 5 emoji options (great, good, okay, difficult, rough) stored as mood ID
  - Mood can be prepended to shutdown_shipped text for visual display
  - Banner visibility: show after 6 PM (hour >= 18) AND shutdown_shipped is empty
  - Session-based dismiss: use useState (not persisted) so banner returns next session
  - DailyPlan already has shutdown_shipped and shutdown_blocked fields - no type changes needed
  - Haptics.notificationAsync for success feedback on save
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-023
- What was implemented: Created habits data layer with CRUD hooks
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useHabits.ts (created - all types and hooks)
  - src/hooks/index.ts (updated - export new hooks and types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Habit type matches backend: id, name, position, is_active
  - Backend habits API response wraps habits in { habits: [] } object
  - useReorderHabits uses positions array: [{ id: number, position: number }]
  - All mutation hooks include optimistic updates with rollback on error
  - habitsKeys pattern follows same structure as dailyPlanKeys and goalsKeys
  - Import hooks from @/hooks (barrel export)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-024
- What was implemented: Built habits management screen with full CRUD functionality
- Files changed:
  - package.json (added react-native-draggable-flatlist)
  - app/settings/habits.tsx (created - full habits management UI)
  - app/_layout.tsx (added settings/habits route)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - react-native-draggable-flatlist uses ScaleDecorator for scale effect during drag
  - Use onLongPress with delayLongPress={150} for drag activation (better UX than immediate drag)
  - RenderItemParams<T> provides item, drag, isActive for render item callback
  - Swipeable from react-native-gesture-handler: use ref for programmatic close after delete
  - GestureHandlerRootView must wrap the entire draggable list content
  - React Compiler requires state setters in useCallback dependency arrays (setEditingHabitId, setEditValue, etc.)
  - Settings sub-screens need Stack.Screen entry in root layout (_layout.tsx)
  - MAX_HABITS constant (10) enforced on both add button and handleAddHabit
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-025
- What was implemented: Created goals data layer with complete CRUD and AI refinement hooks
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useGoals.ts (enhanced - added types and mutation hooks)
  - src/hooks/index.ts (updated - export new hooks and types)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Goal API response wraps data in objects: { goals: [] } for list, { goal: {} } for detail
  - GoalUser type for creator/assignees includes: id, name, email, avatar_url
  - SMART fields (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time_bound) only included in detail response
  - useRefineGoal mutation returns GoalRefinementResponse with smart_suggestions, alternative_titles, potential_obstacles, milestones
  - Create/update payloads use assignee_ids (array of user IDs) for assigning users to goals
  - GoalResponse includes is_first_goal and is_first_action flags for gamification
  - Cache invalidation: invalidateQueries({ queryKey: goalsKeys.all }) refreshes all goal lists
  - setQueryData for direct cache updates on single goal detail after update
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-026
- What was implemented: Built Goals List Screen with filter tabs and goal cards
- Files changed:
  - app/(tabs)/goals.tsx (complete rewrite with filter tabs, goal cards, FAB)
  - app/_layout.tsx (added goal/create route)
  - app/goal/create.tsx (created placeholder screen)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FAB from react-native-paper provides ready-to-use floating action button
  - Use horizontal ScrollView for filter tabs (not FlatList) for simpler horizontal scrolling
  - STATUS_COLORS and STATUS_LABELS maps provide clean status-to-color/label mappings
  - statusColor + "20" appends 20% opacity for subtle background colors on badges
  - Goal card press state uses Pressable with style function: ({ pressed }) => [styles.card, pressed && styles.pressed]
  - Empty state should include action button to create first item (better UX than FAB alone)
  - FlatList with contentContainerStyle paddingBottom: 100 prevents FAB overlap
  - SafeAreaView edges={["top"]} for screens with custom headers
  - Create placeholder screen when FAB navigates to unimplemented feature (prevents navigation errors)
---

## 2026-01-22 - US-027
- What was implemented: Built complete Goal Detail Screen with all features
- Files changed:
  - app/goal/[id].tsx (complete rewrite with all sections)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - @react-native-community/slider already installed - use Slider component for progress control
  - Progress slider: use onValueChange for local state, onSlidingComplete for API call (avoids excessive requests)
  - Status picker: custom expandable dropdown (TouchableOpacity + View list) rather than using library picker
  - SMART breakdown: only show section if any of the 5 SMART fields are populated (check with .some())
  - Avoid using "children" as a prop name - ESLint error: "Do not pass children as props" - use childGoals instead
  - Prettier auto-fixes inline style arrays when they exceed line length - no manual formatting needed
  - useGoal hook fetches single goal detail with full SMART fields, children, and assignees
  - useUpdateGoal and useDeleteGoal mutations handle optimistic updates and cache invalidation
  - Delete confirmation: Alert.alert with destructive style button + haptic warning feedback
  - Edit navigates to /goal/edit/${goalId} (placeholder route for next story)
---

## 2026-01-22 - US-028
- What was implemented: Built complete Create Goal Screen with all form fields and API integration
- Files changed:
  - app/goal/create.tsx (complete rewrite from placeholder to full implementation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Family members API: GET /families/:id/members returns { members: FamilyMember[] } with user_id, name, email, avatar_url, role
  - FamilyMember type: use user_id (not id) when assigning to goals - the id is the membership id
  - Time scale segmented control: horizontal ScrollView with TouchableOpacity buttons works well for 5+ options
  - DateTimePicker behavior differs by platform: use display="spinner" on iOS for better UX
  - Visibility radio picker: custom implementation with radio circle (outer + inner filled) looks cleaner than library pickers
  - Assignee multi-select: wrap-able row of chips with checkmark icon when selected
  - CreateGoalPayload uses assignee_ids (array of user IDs) for assignment
  - useCreateGoal hook returns GoalResponse with goal.id for navigation to detail screen
  - Refine with AI button placeholder: use dashed border style for "coming soon" features
  - Footer with absolute positioning and paddingBottom: 32 for safe area on iOS

## 2026-01-22 - US-029
- What was implemented: Built AI Goal Refinement feature with full modal and integration
- Files changed:
  - src/components/AIRefinementModal.tsx (new - modal with loading, error, suggestions display)
  - src/components/index.ts (export AIRefinementModal)
  - app/goal/[id].tsx (integrated Refine with AI button and modal)
  - app/goal/create.tsx (integrated "Create & Refine with AI" flow)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Backend refine endpoint requires an existing goal (POST /families/:id/goals/:id/refine)
  - For create screen, use "Create & Refine" flow: create goal first, then refine, then navigate to detail
  - SmartSuggestions type has `string | null` while UpdateGoalPayload expects `string | undefined` - convert null to undefined when applying
  - BottomSheet with BottomSheetScrollView for scrollable modal content
  - Accept/reject pattern: use Set<keyof SmartSuggestions> to track which fields are accepted
  - useEffect with visible + suggestions dependencies to reset acceptedFields when modal opens with new data
  - GoalRefinementResponse.suggestions includes: smart_suggestions, alternative_titles, alternative_descriptions, potential_obstacles, milestones, overall_feedback
  - Import Ionicons icons carefully - "bullseye-outline" may not exist, check @expo/vector-icons docs
